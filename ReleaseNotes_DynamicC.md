KNOWN ISSUES
------------

1. Debugger issues

    -  When debugging a program using either F7 or F8 into or over a
       call to `kbhit()` will cause the debug cursor to disappear. Pressing
       F7 or F8 two more times will make the debug cursor reappear
       following the `kbhit()` call.

    -  The breakpoint highlight for the closing brace of a function
       does not display correctly if the brace is not in the first column
       of the editor window.

    -  The debugger currently only supports 128 breakpoints.  Setting more
       than 128 breakpoints will result in the loss of target communications.

    -  The debugger does not support assembly language single stepping
       over function calls that do not return to the instruction following
       the call such as "_switch". Any attempt to do so will result in
       loss of target communication. Stepping _into_ the function in
       assembly is supported, as is stepping over such functions in C.

    -  If an `ipset` or `ipres` instruction is followed immediately by an
       `rst 0x28`, the debug kernel will not step over the `rst 0x28`
       correctly,  but will end up in an unexpected location.  When either of
       these  instructions are followed by instructions other than `rst 0x28`,
       the debug  kernel behaves correctly.

    -  The Register Contents debug window (F11) doesn't report the correct
       LXPC  value if it's >= 0xFF.  It reports 0x0FF as "LXPC: FFF" and
       leaves the high nibble off of values >= 0x100 (so 0x123 appears as
       "LXPC: 023").

2. Software modules.

   RabbitWeb gives a cryptic error message for buffer overflow when
   using the `print_select()` statement.  The workaround is to make
   `HTTP_MAXBUFFER` large enough to hold all of the `OPTION` statements
   generated by the `print_select()` statement.

3. Complex casts

   The compiler will not accept multidimensional array types or
   derivatives thereof as cast expressions, even if the cast expression
   is a typedef name. Use a union to work around this problem.

4. Advanced 16-bit memory mode CPU bug

   The Rabbit 4000 CPU's advanced 16-bit memory mode has a defect
   which affects ioe instructions (auxiliary I/O, external I/O)
   and self-timed chip select.  The Dynamic C BIOS has been
   updated to work around this ioe defect on affected boards, all
   of the RCM40xx family.  If absolute top performance is required
   and the User is certain their application is unaffected by the
   ioe bug, the work around can be disabled by adding the
   `__ALLOW_16BIT_AUXIO_DEFECT` macro into Dynamic C's Project
   Options Defines Box.  See the Rabbit 4000 Users Manual Appendix
   B (errata section) or TN255 for complete details.

5. In separate I/D mode, an array declared as

       far char bar[] = {0,1,2,3,...};

   will not compile correctly when the size of the array exceeds the
   size of the root constant space and will give an error that the
   '}' character is missing. The work-around is to specify the size
   of the array as follows:

       far char bar[32000] = {0,1,2,3,...};

6. Highlighting a block of text while in Stop mode

   In some cases, depending on the specific text, highlighting a block of text
   can result in a flyover watch which returns a copy of that text in the hint
   window.

7. Using `#pragma SIZEOF32` can result in a `sizeof` problem for a large
   struct.

   Using `#pragma SIZEOF32` allows the argument of `sizeof` to be up to 4GB 
   but will return an incorrect value without warning or error if the argument
   involves a struct of size 32K or larger. When using `#pragma SIZEOF32`,
   always restore to the default with `#pragma SIZEOF16` following the use
   of sizeof.

8. Initialized global and static variables and `#GLOBAL_INIT` expressions run
   with a limited stack (256 bytes).  Deeply nested functions (including
   `printf()`) will cause a loss of target communications.

9. Cast ternary operator(s) if both values do not have the same type and type
   qualifiers - example:  `condition ? &aFarChar : (far char *)NULL`.
   In the example, if condition is true and `NULL` is not cast, a near address
   is erroneously returned.

10. As of 10.66, symbols are distinguished using the first 63 characters of the
    name.  Older versions used 31 characters, the minimum per the ANSI
    specification.  If a long symbol name is used as a library module label
    (i.e., in a BeginHeader statement), the library's .MD1 file will contain
    the short version of the name, and the module will not be found.  For
    example:

        /*** BeginHeader A12345678911234567892123456789312 ***/
        extern int A12345678911234567892123456789312;
        /*** EndHeader ***/
        int A12345678911234567892123456789312;

    will generate the error `line  XXX : ERROR MY_LIB.LIB : Undefined
    (but used) global label A12345678911234567892123456789312.` The
    workaround is to change the timestamp on the library file (e.g.,
    modify it and save it) and recompile.  The .MD1 file will be
    regenerated with the correct (longer) module label.

11. More than one `return` statement in a cofunction will result in 
    unpredictable behavior.

12. For `auto int i`, the expression `(far*)&i` should be `(far int*)&i`,
    but the first form will produce confusing error messages:

        Invalid expression.
        Missing character ';'.
        Missing character ')'.
        Not a pointer, cannot dereference.

13. A `c return` statement in an assembly block can produce an error like
    `Undefined (but used) global label .DCLAB__ZW00000190` in large programs.
    The assembly block can be ended followed by the `return` statement in C
    followed by the remaining assembly in a new assembly block.

14. The active status of hardware breakpoints is not retained when a program
    restarts. Each breakpoint must be modified in some way such as toggling a
    checkbox so that the “Update” button becomes active.

15. Setting a hardware breakpoint on some internal I/O addresses can lead to
    a target communication error. Since setting a breakpoint mask to 0xffffff
    will include all internal I/O address, the address and mask should be set
    to include only the intended range of addresses.

16. Programs larger than 512K will not compile to RAM successfully on an
    RCM5450W core module. Compiling such programs to flash works fine.

17. Number of dimensions in array initializer are not checked against the
    array declaration.

    Dynamic C will compile an initializer with too few dimensions without
    complaining:

        // two few dimensions in initializer
        const static int a[][3][2] = {{11, 12}, {21, 22}};

    The results are undefined.  If there are too many dimensions in the
    initializer, Dynamic C will indicate an error `} is missing/expected.`

18. For functions with both a near and far syntax, function help is available
    only using the unadorned name.  For instance, placing the cursor over
    `_f_memset` will not find the function help for `memset`.  In order to
    find function help for a function prepended with either `_n_` or `_f_`,
    such as `_f_memset`, separate the main part of the function name before
    pressing `Ctrl+h`.

19. A function that returns a struct by value does not work correctly within a
    cofunction. A work around is to have the function return a static struct
    by reference and then dereference the function result on assignment in the
    cofunction, e.g.:

        struct point { int x; int y; };

        struct point *foop(void) {
           static struct point tmp;

           tmp.x = 3;
           tmp.y = 4;
           return &tmp;
        }

        cofunc void co_func(void) {
           struct point tmp;

           tmp = *foop();   // dereference the result at time of assignment
           printf("cofunction by reference, x=%d, y=%d\n", tmp.x, tmp.y);
        }

        void main(void) {
           struct point tmp;

           costate {
              wfd co_func();
           }
        }

20. An index variable used in calling an indexed cofunction cannot be auto. The
    index variable must have static (local) or global storage, e.g.:

        #define INDICES 5

        cofunc void my_icofunc[INDICES](void)
        {
           ;
        }

        void main(void)
        {
           static int i;

           while (1) {
              for (i = 0; i < INDICES; ++i) {
                 costate {
                    wfd my_icofunc[i]();
                 }
              }
           }
        }

21. Auto pointers to CoData structures cannot be used in named costatements. The
    CoData structure pointer must have static (local) or global storage, e.g.:

        #define NUMTASKS 5

        void main(void)
        {
           auto int i;
           static CoData task[NUMTASKS];
           static CoData *ptr2codata;

           for (i = 0; i < NUMTASKS; ++i)
              CoBegin(&task[i]);

           while (1) {
              for (i = 0; i < NUMTASKS; ++i) {
                 ptr2codata = &task[i];
                 costate ptr2codata always_on {
                    ;
                 }
              }
           }
        }

22. Dynamic C currently does not allow function pointers to return structures
    by value. The following code snippet will generate an error:

        typedef struct { int a; } my_struct_t;
        my_struct_t (*func_ptr)();
        main() {
           my_struct_t s;
           s = func_ptr();
        }

23. Assembly labels within `#asm` blocks inside C functions are treated as if
    they are local C-labels, rather than existing within their own scopes.
    In the following code, the expected behavior would be an "unknown label"
    error on the `jp` to `foo` since there is no global label `foo` defined.
    However, the linker associates the local label with the `jp` instruction
    and the code compiles.

    Note that this behavior only occurs between `#asm` blocks within C
    functions. It does not exist between stand-alone `#asm` blocks or between
    blocks in separate C functions.

        void func(void) {
           #asm
              jp foo  ; This jumps to the label in the next block
           #endasm
           // Some C code
           #asm
              foo:    ; The jp above lands here
           #endasm
        }

24. The `strtod` function's underflow detection fails when converting strings
    of the following forms and lengths:

        ".00000000000000000000000000000000000001"
        ".000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
        . . .
        ".00000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
        ".1e-38
        ".01e-38"
        . . .
        ".00000000000000000000000000000000000001e-38"

25. Dynamic C's assembler does not support embedded C return statements (e.g.
    `c return;` or `c return X;`) within an asm block that is within a C
    function. All such occurrences have been removed from standard libraries
    (i.e. DMA.LIB, FFT.LIB) and no occurrences exist in standard samples code.
    Custom assembly code with embedded C return statements as described above
    should be rewritten such that any explicit or implicit return from the C
    function is done in standard C code.

26. Complex macros inside a one-line for-loop may fail to compile, with an
    internal error (`Internal error: input stream non-existant. Compiler
    confused. Look for previous syntax error.`) that requires Dynamic C to be
    restarted.

    Work-around: replace

        for (i = 0; i < max; i++){ complex_macro; }

    with

        for (i = 0; i < max; i++){
           complex_macro;
        }

27. When compiling an initialized array of unspecified dimension(s) in a nested
    scope, Dynamic C does not generate a jump over the initializer data, which
    results in errant execution of the initializer data. One work around is to
    avoid declaration of such arrays in nested scope. Another work around is to
    ensure all initialized arrays in nested scope have fully specified
    dimensions.

    Work-around example: replace

        while (1) {
           char *foo[] = { "123", "abc" };
           printf("%s   %s\n", foo[0], foo[1]);
        }

    with

        while (1) {
           char *foo[2] = { "123", "abc" };
           printf("%s   %s\n", foo[0], foo[1]);
        }

28. The compiler incorrectly throws an error (`Duplicate 'const' keywords not
    allowed in this context.`) if a function contains multiple, non-pointer
    `const` parameters.

    Work-around example: replace

        void foo(const int bar, const int baz) {}

    with

        typedef const int const_int;
        void foo(const_int bar, const_int baz) {}

29. On platforms with an ASIX Ethernet controller (e.g., RCM42xx, RCM43xx),
    the network stack can get stuck in an infinite loop after executing the
    sequence `ifdown()`/`pd_powerdown()`/`pd_powerup()`/`ifup()`.  Issue
    present since at least Dynamic C 10.60, and might only happen when calling
    `tcp_tick()` while interface is powered down, or calling `ifup()` too soon
    after `pd_powerup()`.  If this affects you, contact Digi and reference
    issue DC-300.

30. The compiler incorrectly reports errors and warnings as occurring on line
    1 if they are beyond line 32,767 of a file.  Limit file sizes by creating
    .LIB modules loaded with `#use`, or .H header files loaded with
    `#include`.

31. Compiler will report `Cannot load object, report to Rabbit.` when trying
    to compile `(0 && j == 0)` in the code below:

        int foo(int i, int j) { return (i == 0 || (0 && j == 0)); }

    This can occur when using constant macros to short-circuit conditionals
    at compile time.  The workaround is to adapt the conditional using the
    macro preprocessor.  In the example above:
    
        int foo(int i, int j) {
            return (i == 0
                #if FOO
                    || (j == 0)
                #endif
                   );
        }

32. The "Start" button may be hidden on the main Rabbit Field Utility screen
    when using certain Windows Display Scaling values (seen at 125% but not
    199%).

33. The command-line compiler fails on project files that contain multiple
    .C files.  As a workaround, compile a single .C file that references
    either libraries (with the `#use` directive) or .H files (with the
    `#include` directive) for additional code.

34. When generating .HEX files, the compiler incorrectly pads the length to
    a multiple of 32, using bytes from the previous block of 32 bytes.  The
    generated .BIN file is the correct length and contains a complete
    firmware image.

35. Shared SPI port code (using `SPIgetSemaphore()` and `SPIsetSemaphore()`)
    was intended for high-speed SPI devices using separate chip select inputs.
    If sharing the TX/RX signals with an async serial device at a lower baud
    rates, you will need to set the baud rate to 460800 before releasing the
    semaphore.  It's possible that just setting TAT1R to the correct value
    will work as well, but changing the baud rate is a reliable workaround.

UPDATE CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------
Reminder: When opening a project in a new version of Dynamic C,
update the "Include Path" tab in the Project Options to use the
new Dynamic C directory.  (Or change it to `.\include` to always
use the current compiler's include directory.)

If updating an existing installation of 10.72D or earlier via the Dynamic C 10
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/digidotcom/DCRabbit_10), you should
manually apply the changes in `ucos2.patch`, found in the Dynamic C
installation directory.

If using I2C with Dynamic C 10.72B on Rabbit 6000 products, you must update
your calls to `I2CRead()` and `I2CWrite()` to pass the slave address
in bits 1-7 instead of bits 0-6 of the first parameter.  This release
restores compatibility with software-based I2C from Dynamic C 10.72A
and earlier.  In addition, the APIs for `I2C_ReadFromSlave()` and
`I2C_WriteToSlave()` now include an index parameter so `I2C_ReadFromSlave()`
can send a START, SLAVE_WRITE, INDEX, START, SLAVE_READ sequence for
efficient reads.  If necessary, use the new `CC_REV` compiler macro to
conditionally compile code so it can work with new and old APIs.

If updating iDigi-enabled applications to Dynamic C 10.72B or later, you
*should* update all IDIGI/idigi references to CLOUD/cloud and replace
`#use "iDigi.lib"` with `#use "Device_Cloud.lib"`.  All of the iDigi
libraries, APIs and samples were renamed to match the (then) current
"Device Cloud" name for that service.  `iDigi.lib` remains with macros
mapping old names to new ones.

UPDATE BEST PRACTICES
---------------------
Digi recommends testing the new release in a controlled environment with
your application before you deploy firmware to production devices.

## 10.72D (April 13, 2018)
This is a required release for Wi-Fi products, and recommended for all others.

The primary focus of this release is to address the Key Reinstallation
Attacks (KRACK) against WPA2.  Dynamic C includes two versions of
wpa_supplicant -- v0.2.8 used when WPA_USE_EAP isn't defined and
v0.5.11 for when it is.  This release updates to the last stable
release of each series and patches them to block the KRACKs.

The release also addresses routing problems present on RCM66xxW
modules that enable both Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces.

### BUG FIXES
- DC-255: Updated change from 10.72B release related to IP address
  reuse during PPP handshaking.  Users can re-enable the disabled
  feature by defining `IPCP_ENABLE_IPADDR_REUSE`.
- DC-337: Store correct value for `freq_divider`.  Was previously one
  less than the correct value which would affect baud rate
  calculations.
- DC-344: Fix error when setting default Wi-Fi router when also
  using Ethernet.
- DC-345: Fix behavior of `IFG_WIFI_MODE` option to `ifconfig()`.
- DC-346: Fix default route when using both Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
- DC-357: Document compiler error (aborts compilation of valid code)
  as "Known Issue #31".
- Document Rabbit Field Utility UI issue when using Display Scaling
  as "Known Issue #32".

### OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
An I2C-related change from 2017-08-30 was erroneously tagged as
included in the 10.72C release.  The shipping installer for 10.72C
did not include the commit and it first appeared in this release.

---

## 10.72C (August 16, 2017)
This is a recommended release.

### NEW FEATURES
- Adds support for RCM4320 variant -- an RCM4310 with 1MB of SRAM
  for firmware (instead of 512KB) and a 4MB serial flash for storage
  (instead of 1MB).
- Updated `sdflash.lib` to support SDHC cards from 4GB to 32GB.  Note
  that Dynamic C still does not support FAT32.  When using SDHC cards
  you must format them on the Rabbit with up to four FAT16 partitions,
  but you can still read and write them on Mac/Windows/Linux.
  Email Jim.Pause@digi.com if interested in FAT32 support in Dynamic C.
- Updated `FAT16.lib` to work on SDHC cards (larger than 2GB).
- Defined a `CC_REV` macro as 'C' for use in compiler version checks.
- Added RCM6xxx support for Panel-Mount Keypad/Display Unit (Digi part
  number 20-101-0502).

### ENHANCEMENTS
- Updated TLS to send Server Name Indication (SNI) in ClientHello.
  Includes updates to HTTP, SMTP and POP3 client libraries.
- Updated X.509 certificate handling to process `subjectAltName`
  extension, allowing for improved hostname matching in TLS client
  connections.

### BUG FIXES
- Addresses compiler errors with `I2C_HW.LIB` for Rabbit 6000 boards.
- HTTP client now sends correct Content-Type on non-blocking PUT/POST.
- Moved duplicated `MODBUS_CRC()` from `modbus_{master,slave}.lib` to
  `CRC16.LIB`.
- Updated FTP server samples to work with default FileZilla FTP client
  settings.
- DC-295: `Get_Stack_Size()` returns correct size instead of smallest
  stack size.
- DC-304: After DHCP fallback, further DHCP discovery would fail.
- DC-310: Revert commit that incorrectly processed slave address in
  `I2CRead()` and `I2CWrite()` calls on Rabbit 6000 hardware with DC 10.72B.
- DC-317: Correctly set interrupt level when `RS232_INT_LEVEL != 1`.
- DC-322: Don't hard-code keysize in `AES{en,de}cryptStream_CBC()`
  and `_CBC_XMEM()` functions.  Now works correctly for AES-192/256.
- DC-332: Fix Rabbit 6000 link recovery, broken in pre-release 10.72C.
- DC-334: Ignore non-fatal "warning" TLS alerts instead of aborting
  connection.
- GITHUB-13: Fix return value of `_n_strcpy()`.
- GITHUB-14: Fix bug in `httpc_skip_headers()` for non-blocking
  connections.
- RCM-143: Only call `dhcp_tick()` if interface is up.
- RCM-143: When Ethernet powered down, link status should always be
  "down" (changed for Rabbit 6000 and ASIX-based hardware).

### OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
- Disabled incomplete I2C slave mode for Rabbit 6000 hardware.
- Please note that while all Rabbit MAC addresses have previously
  used an OUI (manufacturer code) of 00:90:C2, future products may
  ship with an alternate OUI.  Please be proactive and replace any
  code that requires that byte sequence.
- Added "Known Issue" about compiler errors/warnings in files that
  exceed 32,767 lines.

## 10.72B (October 31, 2016)
This is a recommended release.

This release builds upon the TLS 1.2 update in Dynamic C 10.72A,
by adding support for SHA384 and SHA512 hashes in TLS communications
and X.509 certificates.  It also brings back support for TLS 1.0 in
outbound client connections to support legacy servers that have not
implemented TLS 1.2 yet.  Details in function help for `TCPCONFIG`,
`tls_set_flags()`, `httpc_set_tls()`, `pop3_set_tls()`, and
`smtp_set_tls()`.

There's an important update to `ASIX.LIB` which should finally
resolve all outstanding link recovery issues.

### NEW FEATURES
- Adds support for SHA384/SHA512 hashes:
  - New library and updated sample.
  - TLS update to support for SHA384 and SHA512 hashes.
  - X.509 update to support sha224, sha384 and sha512 signatures.
- Adds support for falling back to TLS 1.0 on outbound (client)
  TLS connections.
- Adds source code and tools for building binaries in BIOS directory
  (cold loaders and pilot BIOSes).
- Adds sample for run-from-RAM boards to download a copy of the boot
  flash via HTTP.  Useful for firmware recovery and analysis of flash
  contents.
- Improves boot time on 6000-based hardware (now < 1 second) when
  `_FAST_BIOS_LOAD` macro defined in Project Options [DC-269].
- Replaces the outdated SSL Certificate Creation GUI (in
  `Utilities/SSL_Utilities`) with command-line OpenSSL version 1.0.2j.
  Added instructions on using OpenSSL to create certificates, which
  should allow for more control over key size and choice of hashing
  algorithm.

### BUG FIXES
- Corrected compilation errors when `X509_VERBOSE` or `WPA_VERBOSE` defined.
- Fix bug in `http_finderrbuf()` affecting variable names longer than
  `SSPEC_MAXSPEC` characters.
- DC-216: Update I2C for Rabbit 6000 hardware.
- DC-255: Disabled IP address reuse during negotiation of PPP
  connections with other active interfaces (e.g. Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
- DC-260: Improve ASIX Ethernet link recovery by allowing more time
  to establish link after turning PHY back on (8s vs. 2s).
- DC-264: IIS servers require `signature_algorithms` extension in TLS
  Client Hello.
- DC-264: Increase TCP receive buffer size to account for additional
  TLS 1.2 overhead.
- DC-267: FTP server incorrectly stripped leading slash from absolute
  pathnames in STOR, MKD and RMD commands.
- DC-275: Disable attempted lease renewal for permanent DHCP leases.
- DC-280: Fix for serial connections with 2 stop bits.  First byte was
  always sent with 1 stop bit.
- DC-281: Correct invalid JSON generated by `web_iter_next()` (RabbitWeb).
- DC-283: Repeatedly setting a gateway then deleting all routers no
  longer fills APR cache.
- DC-285: Fix possible overflow when calculating PMKSA reauth timeout
  for WPA/WPA2 Enterprise Wi-Fi connections.
- DC-287: Fix for FTP client uploading files using a datahandler instead
  of a fixed-length buffer (broken by DC-129 in Dynamic C 10.72A).
- DC-290: Ensure that `SSL_set_private_key()` always returns error upon
  failure to parse key.
- GITHUB-7/DC-265: Handle Ethernet netport interrupt on 6000-based
  hardware so transmit errors don't hold buffers forever.
- RCM-77: Improve Ethernet link recovery on 5000/6000-based hardware.
- RCM-121: Fix buffer overflow caused by large packets on WPA/TKIP
  (but not WPA2/CCMP) networks.

### OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
- Update samples using `SSL_Cert_t` to store certs in far memory and
  not on the stack.
- Optimization from petermcs to reduce code size and speed execution
  of `sha256_process()` in `SHA2.LIB`.
- DC-268: Changed some function variables in FTP server from "static"
  to "auto".
- DC-284: Updated `firmware_info_t` structure to include compiler revision.

## 10.72A (March 17, 2016)
This is a recommended release.

The big change for this release is that Dynamic C is now an [Open
Source project on GitHub](https://github.com/digidotcom/DCRabbit_10).
It includes source code to the previously-encrypted Wi-Fi and SSL
libraries, and the license was changed to MPL 2.0 (Libraries) and
ISC (Samples).

This release was made as 10.72A since it does not include changes to
the compiler and only contains modified libraries, samples and
documentation.  It uses shortcuts (`.lnk` files) to launch the compiler
with a command-line parameter of `-c A`, forcing the compiler to
identify itself as 10.72A and use registry entries for version 10.72A.

The installer is also smaller, due to the removal of an outdated XCTU
installer, the "XBee GPIO GUI" utility/source (designed for sample
programs removed in the 10.70 release), and a Microsoft .NET installer
(`dotnetfx.exe`) required by that utility.

The latest version of XCTU is on [Digi's website](http://www.digi.com/xctu).

### NEW FEATURES
- Includes library and utility programs to write a System ID Block
  to a device's flash (`Utilities/Write_ID`).
- Incorporates NAND flash library patch (40002851_A, 2012-12-01) for
  Micron/Numonyx/ST NAND256W3A (32MB) devices used in new hardware.

- Incorporates Serial Flash update (40002882_A) for revision E of 
  45DB641 chips used in new hardware.

- Add `httpc_set_extra_headers()` API to `HTTPC.LIB` for user code to
  add headers to outbound requests.

- Upgrades TLS (Transport Layer Security, aka SSL/HTTPS)
  implementation from 1.0 to 1.2.
  - Is compatible with modern web browsers.
  - Removes support for insecure SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 protocols.
  - Removes support for insecure RC4 cipher and MD5 digest.
  - Automatically enables required AES128_CBC cipher.
  - Defaults to 2048-bit RSA keys (previously 1024-bit).
  - Adds optional AES256_CBC cipher, SHA256 digests, and support for
    SHA256 signatures in X.509 (TLS/SSL) certificates.

### BUG FIXES
- Fix conversion of RabbitWeb multi-select 32-bit enum to text.
  (contributed by titobrasolin).
- Initialize `struct tm` in `_atodt()` before use to avoid random
  hour/minute/second values affecting result (contributed by
  titobrasolin).
- Fix return value of `asix_ioctl()` for unsupported features.  Was
  previously returning uninitialized value from stack instead of 0.
- DC-6: Fix rebalancing of HTTPS Rx and Tx transport buffers,
  enabling HTTPS upload of large files.
- DC-10: Fix PPP baud rate calculations, corrects problem with
  9600 baud.
- DC-19: ASIX PHY link-fail recovery now works after extended cable
  disconnection (20 minutes or more).
- DC-27: Improved `SPI.LIB`'s `SPIWrRd()` function's Rabbit 6000-specific
  work around.
- DC-31: `HTTP.LIB`'s `zhtml_handler()` function now correctly handles
  `HttpState` (unsigned) `extlen` values greater than 32767.
- DC-55: Fixed multiple stacks (as when using e.g. uC/OS-II
  multi-tasking) misplacement bug affecting Dynamic C versions 10.62
  through 10.72, inclusive.
- DC-78: Fix memory leaks in `idigi_put()` and `idigi_upload()`.
- DC-117: `PPP.LIB`'s `LCPsendEchoReply()` now echoes the request's
  non-zero length data.
- DC-129: Fix `FTP_CLIENT` uploading files smaller than TCP socket
  buffer size.
- DC-130: SNMP: Correctly store zero-length octet strings and prevent
  xmem window wraparound (in all data formats).
- DC-215: Fix keepalive handling in `tcp.lib`.
- DC-200: Update some incorrect macro names (contributed by Richard
  Pletcher).
- DC-200: Update start of write buffer when adjusting TCP buffer split
  between read/write.  Possible fix for broken HTTPS Upload
  (contributed by Richard Pletcher).
- DC-207: Correctly render SSI/RabbitWeb (shtml/zhtml) tags spanning
  multiple 256-byte blocks in files on FAT filesystem.
- DC-217: Add full HDLC support for Rabbits 4000-6000, including
  sample program.

  files on FAT filesystem due to stale data in `SSpecFileUnion`
  structure allocated from a pool of memory.
- DC-241: Function `sdspi_process_command()` in `SDFLASH.LIB` wasn't
  releasing the SPI semaphore (contributed by Mark Leichty).
- DC-248: Update `HTTPS_CLIENT.c` to follow URL redirects and correctly
  print `far` hostname from `httpc_Socket`.
- GITHUB-1: Correct invalid `strtol()` and `strtoul()` behavior.
- GITHUB-2: Fix `%g` formatting error for floats smaller than 0.1.
- RCM-7: Don't reset TCP keepalive timer on reused connections.
- RCM-109: Fix issue preventing module from joining WPA mixed-mode
  (TKIP/CCMP) networks.

---

## 10.72 (December 2012)
This is a recommended release.

### NEW FEATURES
- FCC-labeled versions of RCM6600W family boards are locked to
  the Americas region code.

- The following new options are available in the command line
  Rabbit Field Utility (`Utilities\clRFU.exe`):

      -i pathname Specify application binary image file, -i BinPath
      -si         Print formatted contents of System ID block
      -ma         Print formatted MAC address
      -bi         Print Board ID
      --boot-flashtype flash_type
                  Specify flash_type as either parallel or serial
      --boot-memorywidth memory_width
                  Specify memory_width (in bits) as either 8 or 16
      --boot-ram-selectenable mb0cr_value
                  Specify mb0cr_value in the range [0,7]
                  /CS0:3 in bits 1:0, /OE0:1 (== /WE0:1) in bit 2

  Previously, the command line RFU required that its first
  parameter must be the path name of the binary image to load to
  the Rabbit target board.

  Now, when the new `-i pathname` option is not specified, it is
  possible to check Rabbit board information via the new `-si`
  and/or `-ma` and/or `-bi` options without loading a binary
  image to the Rabbit target board.

- The Rabbit Field Utility, after successfully loading a binary
  image onto a Rabbit target board, now automatically starts
  program execution. `RabbitBios.c` has been updated to provide the
  following three behavior options after the RFU has started
  program execution:

  -  Default behavior. When neither `RFU_BIN_RUN_IMMEDIATELY` nor
     `RFU_BIN_WAIT_FOR_RUN_MODE` are defined, a BIN program image
     successfully loaded by RFU 4.72 or later will run BIOS code
     only and then will wait in an idle loop until a hardware
     reset occurs. Following a hardware reset and with the
     programming cable disconnected, BIOS code and user code will
     execute as usual.

     This mode of operation most closely emulates the behavior of
     RFU versions prior to 4.72. It can also be useful in test
     fixture code, for example, where a test fixture can control
     at least one of the `SMODEx` levels as well as the `RESET`
     level, and manual disconnection of the programming cable is
     inconvenient or undesirable.

  -  When `RFU_BIN_RUN_IMMEDIATELY` is defined in Dynamic C's
     Project Options' Defines tab, a BIN program image
     successfully loaded by RFU 4.72 or later will run both BIOS
     code and user code immediately after loading, with the
     programming cable still connected. With the programming
     cable disconnected, BIOS code and user code will execute as
     usual.

     This mode of operation is enforced when Dynamic C's debug
     kernel is enabled. It can also be useful in test fixture
     code, for example, where a test fixture can not or does not
     control the `SMODEx` levels and manual disconnection of the
     programming cable is inconvenient or undesirable.

  -  When `RFU_BIN_WAIT_FOR_RUN_MODE` is defined in Dynamic C's
     Project Options' Defines tab, a BIN program image
     successfully loaded by RFU 4.72 or later will run BIOS code
     and then pause in an idle loop, waiting for the programming
     cable to be disconnected. As soon as the programming cable
     is disconnected, user code will begin to execute. With the
     programming cable disconnected, BIOS code and user code will
     execute as usual.

     This mode of operation can be useful in test fixture code,
     for example, where a test fixture can control at least one
     of the `SMODEx` levels and manual disconnection of the
     programming cable is inconvenient or undesirable.

### ENHANCEMENTS
- The `Lib\Rabbit4000\NandFlash\nflash.lib` driver library has been
  updated with support for Micron/Numonyx/ST NANDxxxW3A nand
  flash devices. Previously supported nand flash devices, used on
  RCM4000 and RCM4050 boards, have been discontinued and are no
  longer available. As of 01-Dec-2012, new production RCM4000 and
  RCM4050 boards will have a Micron/Numonyx/ST NAND256W3A (32MB)
  nand flash device installed.
  Custom applications which use nand flash, whether based on
  RCM4000, RCM4050 boards or a custom nand flash board design,
  should be recompiled using Dynamic C 10.72 in order to support
  the new, increased selection of small-block nand flash devices.
- The EXCEPTION(x) macro is no longer used in any standard
  Dynamic C code and is now deprecated. Please refer to the
  associated deprecation comments in ERRORS.LIB for more
  information.
- iDigi access via a PPP serial port can now be hosted on an
  alternate parallel port by defining one of `IDIGI_PPP_USE_PORTD`
  or `IDIGI_PPP_USE_PORTE` before `#use idigi.lib`.

### BUG FIXES
- Defect #41708. Prevented possible program hang and possible
  false-positive file transfer success result in `ftp_client.lib`.
- Defect #41912. When `HTTP_CUSTOM_HEADERS` is defined and used, an
  incorrect buffer offset calculation results in corrupted HTTP
  header buffer content.
- Defect #42073. The `digOutConfig_H()` function in `BLxS2xx.LIB` now
  returns the expected 0 result on success.
- Defect #43173. Dynamic C's run time error reporting now
  consistently reports the return address on the stack when
  `exception()` is called.
