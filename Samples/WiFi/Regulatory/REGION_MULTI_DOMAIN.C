   region_multi_domain.c

	This program is used with 802.11 wifi devices operating on
   their corresponding prototyping or interface boards.

	Description
	===========
	This sample requires an access point that supports and is configured
	for 802.11d.

   This program demonstrates how the multi-domain option can be used
   for configuring your device to meet regional regulations. The demo
   also includes doing pings, which will indicate that the wifi
   device has successfully received country information from your
   access point.

   General info:
   -------------
   The 802.11d region you select will automatically determine the
   power and channel requirements for operating your wifi device.
   Recommend checking the regulations where your wireless devices
   will be deployed for any other requirements.

	Instructions
	============
   1. Inspect code for ifconfig function usage to see how it
      enables multi-domain for your wifi device.
   2. Set network MACRO parameters.
   3. Enable 802.11d option on your access point and select the proper
   country where your device is deployed (see note below).
   4. Compile and run program.
   5. Step through the menu selections to view user options.
   6. With WIFI_REGION_VERBOSE defined, view STDIO to see channel
      and power settings which the access point has sent to your
      wifi device.

   Note: If the AP doesn't support 802.11d or if the option is not
   enabled on the AP, then your wifi device will not be able to
   associate with the AP.
