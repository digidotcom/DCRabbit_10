        Samples\FILESYSTEM\FAT_WRITE_MBR.C

        Requires that you run this on a core module with a FAT compatible
        flash memory device.  This sample works with the primary device
        defined by MBR_DRIVER_INIT as the default.  If you need to work
        with a different device, uncomment the appropriate MBR_DRIVER_INIT
        definition to override the core module's primary setting.

        This sample creates multiple partitions on an ERASED flash device.
        It only writes the partition table to the MBR, it does not
        format the individual partitions.  This can be done through the
        sample programs fmt_device or fat_shell.

        If the device is not erased, it will exit with an error message.

        You can erase a SD flash card by using sdflash_inspect and
        clearing the pages 0, 1 & 2.  Be aware that multiple
        partitions on a SD card are not supported by most PC's, so if
        you need your SD card to be PC compatible, use one partition.

        You can erase a serial flash device by using sflash_inspect and
        clearing the pages 0, 1, 2 & 3.
