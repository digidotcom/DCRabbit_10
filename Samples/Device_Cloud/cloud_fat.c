   Simple Device Cloud sample, to demonstrate FAT filesystem.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Instructions:
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   Visit https://devicecloud.digi.com/ to create a test account if you have
   not already done so.  You can also access the Device Cloud documentation
   at that site.

   Compile and run this sample.  You may need to place the following
   definitions in the Options->ProjectOptions->Defines tab:

      ROOT_SIZE_4K = 7U
      XMEMCODE_SIZE = 0x90000
      _SYS_MALLOC_BLOCKS=10
      _FIRMWARE_NAME_=""
      _FIRMWARE_VERSION_=0x0101
      _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP="10.10.6.100"

   The first 3 options may not be necessary (and can be adjusted up or down
   to suit the particular board being used).  The _FIRMWARE_* macros are
   needed if you enable firmware updates by defining CLOUD_USE_RPU.
   _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP and related network configuration macros may also
   be defined to set an initial "factory default" configuration.  See
   tcpconfig.lib and the network programming manual for details.  The
   default Device Cloud network configuration uses DHCP, with a fallback to the
   given static IP address.

   When running, navigate to https://devicecloud.digi.com/, log in, and add the
   board using the '+' button - this is only necessary the first time
   you run Device Cloud on a given board.  If you defined CLOUD_USE_ADDP, then the
   board will automatically appear in the list of devices which may be
   added.  When the board is added, you can double click on it to view
   and change the network configuration settings.

   Some configuration settings may cause the board to reboot.  This sample
   implements this by calling exit(0).  When using the Dynamic C debugger,
   you can simply hit F9 to run the program again (no need to recompile).
   In a real deployment, exit(0) causes the board to reboot.

   When changing the network configuration using Device Cloud, the configuration
   is saved in non-volatile storage and will be used next time the program
   (or any other Device Cloud sample) is run.  The macro settings you define
   such as _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP are only used the first time the Device Cloud samples
   are run.  Thereafter, it uses any settings set via the Device Cloud server,
   and saved in flash.

   If you accidentally configure a bad network setting (e.g. by setting a
   non-existent gateway address), then the board will try to use the
   last-known-good configuration if the "current" configuration cannot
   connect to the Device Cloud server.

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------


   To do something with this sample, go to the Device Cloud user interface
   and select the "Web Services Console".

   1. Seelct your target device using the SCI Targets button.

   2. Select Examples->SCI->File System Service->Upload File and the following
      XML will be available.

   3. Edit the path name to make the XML look like the following.  The
      critical thing is the initial "/A/" in the path name, since that
      is significant to the Rabbit filesystem.  And yes, it IS case sensitive.

   4. The file data can be changed (if you know Base64!) but the default is
      the string "file contents" when decoded.  It is always the decoded
      contents which are stored on the Rabbit.

<sci_request version="1.0">
  <file_system>
    <targets>
      <device id="00000000-00000000-0090C2FF-FF000000"/>
    </targets>
    <commands>
      <put_file path="/A/fooble.txt">
        <data>ZmlsZSBjb250ZW50cw==</data>
      </put_file>
    </commands>
  </file_system>
</sci_request>

	5. Hit the "Send" button: this will create a file called fooble.txt on
   	the first FAT partition (A).

   6. Then, you can retrieve the file using

<sci_request version="1.0">
  <file_system>
    <targets>
      <device id="00000000-00000000-0090C2FF-FF000000"/>
    </targets>
    <commands>
      <get_file path="/A/fooble.txt"/>
    </commands>
  </file_system>
</sci_request>

	7. Examine the results on the right hand upper pane (Web Services
   Responses).

   8. Other related filesystem requests can be set using the
   		Examples->SCI->File System Service
   	menu in the user interface, including listing and deleting files.
      You can put multiple elements inside the <command> element, in
      order to execute a sequence of operations.
