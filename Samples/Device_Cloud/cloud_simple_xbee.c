	Simple Device Cloud sample, with XBee functionality.

	This shows basic use of Device Cloud to view and change node settings on an
   XBee network.

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	Instructions:
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Visit https://devicecloud.digi.com/ to create a test account if you have
	not already done so.  You can also access the Device Cloud documentation
	at that site.

	Compile and run this sample.  You may need to place the following
	definitions in the Options->ProjectOptions->Defines tab:

		ROOT_SIZE_4K = 7U
		XMEMCODE_SIZE = 0x90000
		_SYS_MALLOC_BLOCKS=20
		_FIRMWARE_NAME_=""
		_FIRMWARE_VERSION_=0x0101
		_PRIMARY_STATIC_IP="10.10.6.100"

   [Setting _SYS_MALLOC_BLOCKS=20 is required because the RCI XBee
   interface may use a large amount of RAM initially, which is freed
	after initialization is complete.]

	The first 3 options may not be necessary (and can be adjusted up or down
	to suit the particular board being used).  The _FIRMWARE_* macros are
	needed if you enable firmware updates by defining CLOUD_USE_RPU.
	_PRIMARY_STATIC_IP and related network configuration macros may also
	be defined to set an initial "factory default" configuration.  See
	tcpconfig.lib and the network programming manual for details.  The
	default Device Cloud network configuration uses DHCP, with a fallback to the
	given static IP address.

	When running, navigate to https://devicecloud.digi.com/, log in, and add the
	board using the '+' button - this is only necessary the first time
	you run Device Cloud on a given board.  If you defined CLOUD_USE_ADDP, then the
	board will automatically appear in the list of devices which may be
	added.  When the board is added, you can double click on it to view
	and change the network configuration settings.

	Some configuration settings may cause the board to reboot.  This sample
	implements this by calling exit(0).  When using the Dynamic C debugger,
	you can simply hit F9 to run the program again (no need to recompile).
	In a real deployment, exit(0) causes the board to reboot.

	When changing the network configuration using Device Cloud, the configuration
	is saved in non-volatile storage and will be used next time the program
	(or any other Device Cloud sample) is run.  The macro settings you define
	such as _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP are only used the first time the Device Cloud samples
	are run.  Thereafter, it uses any settings set via the Device Cloud server,
	and saved in flash.

	If you accidentally configure a bad network setting (e.g. by setting a
	non-existent gateway address), then the board will try to use the
	last-known-good configuration if the "current" configuration cannot
	connect to the Device Cloud server.
