/*******************************************************************************
        Samples\TcpIp\HTTP\authentication.c

        This program provides three users, "foo", "foo2", and "foo3",
        for whom the passwords are "bar", "bar2", and "bar3",
        respectively.  Each of the three users can be toggled
        between being valid and invalid by pressing '1', '2', or '3'
        on the keyboard, respectively.

        Authentication modes can be set among basic, digest, and no
        authentication by pressing the 'b', 'd', or 'n' keys,
        respectively.

        This program is a modification of STATIC.C that demonstrates
        HTTP Digest Authentication and multiple user support.  Digest
        authentication achieves authentication without cleartext
        transmitting of passwords.  Instead, it uses a digest algorithm
        based on MD5.  Note, however, that this does NOT encrypt the
        web pages--it simply avoids sending the password itself in
        cleartext.  If possible, digest authentication should be used
        in place of basic authentication.

        Most modern browsers support digest authentication, including
        the most recent versions of Internet Explorer, Netscape/Mozilla,
        and Opera.  Netscape and Mozilla ignore the "stale" flag in
        digest authentication, and hence will sometimes ask for the
        username/password again when it is not strictly necessary.
        Also note that Netscape 4.x does NOT support digest
        authentication.
