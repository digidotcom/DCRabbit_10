        cgi_concurrent.c

        This program demonstrates some more complex CGI programming.  In
        particular, it demonstrates how to use the user data area within each
        HTTP state structure, as well as how to share access to a resource.

        To use this program, browse to the Rabbit's web server in your web
        browser.  You will be prompted to enter two numbers that will be added
        by a trained parrot.  If a trained parrot is not available, then a
        software engineer will do.  After submitting the numbers, a prompt is
        generated to Dynamic C's stdio window that asks for the sum of the
        numbers.  Enter the sum at the prompt, and the sum will then be
        displayed in the web browser.

        One useful thing to try with this sample is submitting from multiple
        pages at once.  The code is written such that only one prompt is
        displayed at the stdio window at once--after all, we would not want to
        confuse the poor parrot!  Essentially, only one CGI instance is allowed
        access to the stdio window at a time.

        Also note that the CGI will properly abort if the HTTP connection times
        out (which is set to 60 seconds in this sample--see below).  The stdio
        window is released at this point to be used by another CGI instance.
