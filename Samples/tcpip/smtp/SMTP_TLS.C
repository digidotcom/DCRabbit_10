        smtp_tls.c

        A small program that uses the SMTP library to send an e-mail.
        If the server supports it, TLS will be used to authenticate and
        secure the session.

          *** Don't be fooled: securing mail with TLS does not guarantee
              end-to-end secrecy.  It only allows your mail server
              account name and password to be kept secure from
              eavesdropping. ***

          The use of a trusted (CA) certificate in this sample, and requiring
          verification of the SMTP server certificate, assures that the
          server is not an attacker masquerading as the real server.


        WARNING: This sample suggests use of some freely available SMTP
        services (GMail and Hotmail).  This is for purpose of demonstration
        only and does not imply that use of those services for anything other
        than test/development is permitted by those service providers.
        Please read and abide by the provider's relevant service agreements.


        Before running:

        1) Make sure your basic network configuration is OK, including a
           DNS (name server) and a route to the outside Internet.  The
           default in this sample expects DHCP.  You can use a different
           TCPCONFIG macro and set alternative parameters if necessary.
           (If necessary, use a simpler sample to get this working).
        2) Set up a Google Gmail account for test purposes.  Follow Google's
           instructions for "enabling POP" on this account.  Enabling POP
           also enables mail origination using SMTP.  See http://gmail.com.
        3) Modify the parameters to the smtp_setauth() function call (in this
           sample) to the account name and password that you used in step (2).
           It is most convenient to put these in the
           Options->ProjectOptions->Defines panel e.g.
              SMTP_USER="my_account@gmail.com"
              SMTP_PASS="myPassw0rd"
        4) Modify the FROM, SMTP_TO, SUBJECT and BODY macros to be a valid mail
           recipient and desired message.  Preferably, override SMTP_TO
           in the Defines box to be a valid recipient (that you can check!)
        5) The SMTP_SERVER and SMTP_PORT macros are set appropriately for
           Gmail as of the time this sample was constructed, but you may wish
           to check this if the sample seems to fail in spite of everything.
           You can override these macros in the Defines panel.

        NOTE: you can also use a Hotmail/Outlook.com account once Microsoft
        upgrades their servers from TLS 1.0 to TLS 1.2 (still not the case
        in February 2016).
        
        In this case, #define SMTP_SERVER "smtp-mail.outlook.com", and use your
        Hotmail/Outlook.com credentials in SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASS.  There is no
        need to change any of your Hotmail account settings (still true as
        of February 2016).
        
        Unfortunately, Microsoft in their wisdom use 4096 bit RSA keys in
        some of their certificates, thus you need to #define MP_SIZE 514.
        GMail uses 2048-bit keys, and requires a MP_SIZE of at least 258.
        
        To date, Yahoo does not allow POP3/SMTP access with their free email
        accounts.
