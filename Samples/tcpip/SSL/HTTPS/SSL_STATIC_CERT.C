        Samples\TCPIP\SSL\HTTPS\ssl_static_cert.c

        This sample is based on samples\tcpip\http\static.c, except that it
        shows use of secure HTTP (HTTPS).

        Any of the non-SSL HTTP samples may be altered to allow use of HTTPS
        by defining a few macros at the start of the program, #ximporting
        the required certificate files, and adding
        a few lines of code after http_init() which call SSL_new_cert(),
        SSL_set_private_key(), and https_set_cert().  The macros are:

           USE_HTTP_SSL
           HTTP_SSL_SOCKETS
