        ssl_cgi.c

        A simple web-counter implemented in CGI functions. This
        demonstrates how to add basic dynamic functionality to
        your pages.

		  This program has been modified to use SSL via HTTPS. See the
        SSL comments below for more information.

        ***NOTE*** This sample will NOT compile without first creating a
        certificate with the name and path specified in the #ximport line
        ("#ximport 'cert\mycerts.pem' server_pub_cert") below. See the SSL
        Walkthrough, Section 4.1 in the SSL User's Manual for information
        on creating certificates for SSL programs.

        As of Dynamic C 10.66, it is recommended to use .pem format
        certificates rather than the deprecated .dcc format.  Both formats
        are generated by the certificate utility, however .pem is faster
        at run-time, and is a non-proprietary format.
