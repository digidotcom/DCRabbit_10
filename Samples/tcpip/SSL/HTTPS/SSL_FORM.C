/*******************************************************************************
        ssl_form.c

        An example of a simple HTTP form generation and parsing
        program.  It includes an example of how to handle interdependent
        variables in the form (see the low and high temperature
        variables).

		  This program has been modified to use SSL via HTTPS. See the
        SSL comments below for more information.

        ***NOTE*** This sample will NOT compile without first creating a
        certificate with the name and path specified in the #ximport line
        ("#ximport 'cert\mycerts.pem' server_pub_cert") below. See the SSL
        Walkthrough, Section 4.1 in the SSL User's Manual for information
        on creating certificates for SSL programs.

        As of Dynamic C 10.66, it is recommended to use .pem format
        certificates rather than the deprecated .dcc format.  Both formats
        are generated by the certificate utility, however .pem is faster
        at run-time, and is a non-proprietary format.

        Note that this sample uses both HTTP and HTTPS. This means that
        unprotected resources (see zserver.lib and flashspec) can be
        accessed via both HTTP and HTTPS.
