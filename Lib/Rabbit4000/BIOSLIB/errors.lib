exception							<ERRORS.LIB>

SYNTAX:			int exception(int errCode)

DESCRIPTION:	This function is called by Rabbit libraries when a
runtime error occurs.  It puts information relevant to the runtime
error on the stack and calls the default runtime error handler
pointed to by the ERROR_EXIT macro.  To define your own error
handler, see the defineErrorHandler() function.

When the error handler is called, the following information will
be on the stack:
			SP+0	return adress for error handler call
			SP+2	runtime error code
			SP+4	0x0000 (can be used for additional information)
			SP+6	LXPC when exception() was called
			SP+8	address where exception() was called

RETURN VALUE:	Runtime error code passed to it.

DESCRIPTION:	Sets the BIOS function pointer for runtime errors to
the function pointed to by errfcn.  When a runtime error occurs, the
following information is passed to the error handler on the stack:
			SP+0	- return address for _EH_exceptionRet

			SP+6	- LXPC when exception() was called
			SP+8	- address where exception() was called

The user-defined function should ALWAYS be in root memory.  Specify
'root' at the start of the function definition to ensure this.

error_message                             <ERRORS.LIB>

SYNTAX: unsigned long error_message(int message_index);

DESCRIPTION: Returns a physical pointer to a descriptive string for
             an error code listed in errno.h.

             Consider using strerror() instead, as it will always return a
             printable string (and is therefore appropriate for passing to
             one of the printf() functions).

PARAMETER 1: Positive or negative value of error return code.

RETURN VALUE: Physical address of string, or zero if error code is not
              listed.  Do not pass the return value of error_message()
              directly to a printf() function -- if the error isn't found,
              printf() will dereference a NULL pointer and display whatever
              is stored at address 0.
