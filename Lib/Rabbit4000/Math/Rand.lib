DESCRIPTION: Advanced random number routines for the Rabbit2000/3000
             This library maintains a random number "seed" which has from
             zero to RAND_SEED_BYTES*8 bits of entropy.  The seed is used as
             a starting point for pseudo-random number stream generators, which
             require a random number sequence which is unpredictable to the
             "outside world".  This is necessary for cryptographic operations,
             but is also useful for non-crypto applications such as the
             simple PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) in MATH.LIB (randf(),
              randb() etc.).

             The seed is altered by the application appending a specified
             number of random bits.  For secure applications, the random bits
             should be truly random i.e. derived from observations of the
             real world, not some purely algorithmic process.

             Possible observations include the time interval between key
             presses of a human user, the arrival of network packets, readings
             from an external temperature sensor, or other analog inputs.
             Since clock timings are often used, the seed_clock() function can
             automatically add between 1 and 16 bits of entropy based on the
             Rabbit RTC interval between calls to seed_clock().  The more
             general seed_addbits() function can be used to add an arbitrary
             number of bits.

             seed_bits() reports the current number of entropy bits which have
             been accumulated.  seed_peekbits() reads out the specified number
             of bits (1 to 32) into a long value, but does not delete the bits
             that were returned i.e. the same value will be returned for
             repeated calls.  seed_getbits() reads out and deletes the bits
             tht were reported.  seed_getbits() should be used when independent
             PRNG sequences are to be generated i.e. for crypto applications.

             seed_init() should be used to initialize the seed at boot time.
             This will set 16 bits of entropy from the RTC, plus 32 bits from
             the specified (constant) source e.g. MAC addr.  The latter is not
             random at all, but helps to generate different PRNG streams for
             different Rabbit systems.  If the RTC is not battery backed, then
             the initial seed will be completely predictable and effectively
             have no true entropy.  If battery-backed, the RTC will provide
             between 0 and 16 bits of true entropy depending on how predictable
             the boot-up time is to an external observer (or controller).
             In any case, seed_init() pretends to have 48 bits of entropy,
             or 16 if no initial "salt" value is provided.

             If you use more bits than are actually present, then old bits
             will be returned (since the bit pointers will wrap around in the
             available bit space).  This may be used to advantage if battery-
             backed RAM is used to preserve the entropy bits over a boot
             cycle.  Otherwise, you can specify that the MD5 hashing algorithm
             be used to rescramble the bits whenever the remaining true entropy
             becomes zero (or less).  seed_hash() performs a rehash whenever
             otherwise required.  NB: hashing is only available with Dynamic C
             releases with the TCP/IP libraries, since MD5.LIB is required.
             To disable hashing, you can #define RAND_DISABLE_MD5 before
             including this library, otherwise seed_hash() will automactically
             be enabled.

             This library also includes some PRNGs which are better than the
             simple versions in MATH.LIB.  rand16 returns a 16-bit unsigned
             number based on a fast linear congruential method.  randk
             returns a number between 0 and 1771874 inclusive, based on
             a slower method which gives better sequences.

Change History:
		Mar 3 2003  SJH  Added ability to hash in a 'secret' when rehashing the
                       entropy buffer.  Thus, even if an adversary can see the
                       entire sequence of random numbers, he cannot predict
                       the next (even if there is no entropy added since the
                       last observed output).  The 'secret' is XORed over the
                       entropy buffer before rehashing.  Of course, the security
                       of this method depends on the user selecting a truly
                       random 'secret'.  This may be obtained from, e.g., part
                       of an RSA private key, or from some true entropy from the
                       buffer which is never made observable to an adversary.
                       Note that use of private keys as a hashing secret is not
                       advisable, since the key is then computable if the MD5
                       hash can be inverted - this is currently thought to be
                       impossible (other than by brute force), but things
                       always change...
                       This functionality is accessed via seed_hash_secret().

DESCRIPTION:	Add "bits" bits from the LSBs of *val to the entropy
               buffer.

               Note that if the RAND_USE_CRC symbol is defined, then
               the data provided is first run through the
               standard CRC32 algorithm, in order to avoid any possible
               bias in the total number of 0 and 1 bits.  The CRC
               algorithm will be applied to ceil(bits/16) words of the
               data, thus it will use "extra" bits in the last word to
               update the CRC, however only the requested number of bits
               will be added.  The LSW of the CRC is used as the actual
               bit stream to add, after each group of 16 bits is processed.

seed_clock                         <RAND.LIB>

SYNTAX:			void seed_clock(word bits);

KEYWORDS:		math, random

DESCRIPTION:	Add specified number of bits to entropy source.  The value
               is the difference between the current RTC clock time and
               the previous reading made by seed_clock(), i.e. a time
               difference in 1/32768 sec units.  bits should be between
               1 and 16.  If zero, then the number of bits to add is
               computed as floor(log2(diff))-11 (if less than 1, then
               no bits are added).  For example, at least 1/8 second
               must elapse for 1 bit to be added.  If no bits are added,
               then the "previous reading" will not be altered.

               If timer B is enabled, it is also used to increase the
               resolution of the RTC - this is assumed to add an extra
               5 bits of entropy for each call i.e. the 6 LSBs of timer
               B wrap around in less than 1/32768 seconds, which is
               true if the CPU clock is at least 8.3MHz and timer B is
               being clocked at perclk/2 (=cpu clock/4).  If timer B is
               clocked by perclk/16, then only 3 bits may be added.  If
               clocked by timer A1, then no extra bits are available.
               [Note: one theoretical bit of entropy is lost when timer
               B is used, since the LSB of this counter has a strong bias
               towards zero when read by the CPU.  This is why only 5
               bits are added, not 6.]

               Naturally, for this function to work properly, the time
               intervals should depend on some random external process.

               The most common use for this function is to generate a
               random seed based on interval timings such as user
               keystrokes.  It will be called automatically by the
               TCP/IP library if the sumbol NET_ADD_ENTROPY is defined
               prior to inclusion of DCRTCP.LIB.  If this is done, then
               inter-packet timings will be used to add entropy.

PARAMETER1:    Number of entropy bits to add, or zero to make a fairly
               conservative estimate of the true entropy available.

DESCRIPTION:	Rehash the contents of the entropy buffer using the MD5

DESCRIPTION:	Specify a secret value to hash with the entropy buffer
               when the entropy buffer needs to be rehashed.  This is
               only necessary for secure applications which need to make
               the random number stream unpredictable to an observer who
               can read all or part of the random number stream, and
               there is insufficient true entropy (timings etc.) to
               keep the random number stream from being predictable.

PARAMETER1:    If not NULL, points to 16 bytes of secret, random data.
					If NULL, 16 bytes of data are extracted from the current
               entropy buffer (using seed_getbits()) to form the secret.

DESCRIPTION:	Return an uniform random deviate between 0 and 65535.
               Algorithm is
                 r[i+1] = (r[i]*30809 + 11213) mod 65536.
               where r[0] is the seed value, and r[i] is the value
               returned on the ith successive call.

               rand16() is very fast, and does not repeat the returned
               sequence until 65536 calls have been made, but is not
               guaranteed to be suitable as a generator when results are
               to be taken in groups of n (with n >= 2).  Also,
               the m LSB's cycle with period 2^m, hence do not use the
               LSBs to generate a random number with range smaller than
               2**16.  Instead, use the MSBs or, preferably, use the
               rand16_range() routine.

               This is non-reentrant owing to the need to save the
               previous value in static storage.

RETURN VALUE:  Uniform random integer deviate between 0 and 65535
               inclusive.

KEYWORDS:		math, random

DESCRIPTION:	Return an unsigned random number between low and
               (low + range - 1) inclusive.

               This uses rand16() as a random number generator, then
               computes the return value based on the MSBs of the result
               from rand16().

               Example, simulating toss of 6-sided die:

                 roll = rand16_range(1, 6);
                 // roll = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 with roughly equal
                 // probability.

               Note: you can consider "low" and the return value to be
               signed quantities and still obtain correct results by
               casting the result to int:

                 m += (int) rand16_range(-10, 21) * 0.1;
                 // Add between -1 and 1 inclusive to float m.

PARAMETER1:    Lowest value to return.
PARAMETER2:    Range of values, starting at low.

RETURN VALUE:  Uniform random integer deviate between low and
               (low+range-1) inclusive.

DESCRIPTION:	Return an unsigned random number between 0 and 1771874.
               Algorithm is based on recommendations by D.E.Knuth:
                 r[i+1] = (r[i]*2416 + 374441) mod 1771875.
               where r[0] is the seed value, and r[i] is the value
               returned on the ith successive call.

               This routine is slower than rand16(), since it performs
               long multiplication and division, however the quality
               is superior.  Note that the LSB is always '1', but
               apart from this the LSBs are "more random" than for
               rand16().  Even so, the LSBs should not be used to
               generate numbers with less range.

               This is non-reentrant owing to the need to save the
               previous value in static storage.
