/* START LIBRARY DESCRIPTION ********************************************

	Domain Name System.  This library handles host name resolution.

	Optional configuration macros:

	DISABLE_DNS					If this macro is defined, DNS lookups will not be
									done.  The DNS subsystem will not be compiled in,
									saving some code space and memory.

	DNS_MAX_RESOLVES			Defaults to 4.  Maximum number of concurrent DNS
									queries.  It specifies the size of an internal table
									that is allocated in xmem.

	DNS_MAX_NAME				Defaults to 64.  For backwards compatibility,
									DNS_MAX_NAME will default to MAX_DOMAIN_LENGTH
									(instead of 64) if that macro is set.

									Maximum length of a resolvable host name.  Includes
									any appended default domain and the null-terminator.

									For temporary storage, a variable of this size must
									be placed on the stack in DNS processing. Normally,
									this is not a problem.  However, for µC/OS-II with a
									small stack and a large value for DNS_MAX_NAME, this
									could be an issue.

	DNS_MAX_DATAGRAM_SIZE	Defaults to 512.  Maximum length in bytes of a DNS
									datagram that can be sent or received.  A root data
									buffer of this size is allocated for DNS support.

	DNS_RETRY_TIMEOUT			Defaults to 2000.  Milliseconds to wait before
									retrying a DNS request.  If a request to a nameserver
									times out, then the next nameserver is tried.  If
									that times out, then the next one is tried, in order,
									until it wraps around to the first nameserver again
									(or runs out of retries).

	DNS_NUMBER_RETRIES		Defaults to 2.  Number of times a request will be
									retried after an error or a time-out.  The first
									attempt does not constitute a retry.  A retry only
									occurs when a request has timed out, or when a
									nameserver returns an unintelligible response.  That
									is, if a host name is looked up and the nameserver
									reports that it does not exist and then the DNS
									resolver tries the same host name with or without
									the default domain, that does not constitute a retry.

	DNS_MIN_KEEP_COMPLETED	Defaults to 10000.  Milliseconds a completed request
									is guaranteed to be valid for resolve_name_check().
									After this time, the entry in the internal table
									corresponding to this request can be reused for a
									subsequent request.

	DNS_SOCK_BUF_SIZE			Defaults to 1024.  Size in bytes of an xmem buffer
									for the DNS socket.  Note that this means that the
									DNS socket does not use a buffer from the socket
									buffer pool.

	DNS_ENABLE_REVERSE_LOOKUP	If defined, code to do reverse DNS lookups
									(PTR requests) will be enabled in the library.

	DNS_VERBOSE		If defined, library will print status messages to STDOUT.

	DNS_DEBUG		If defined, functions will be debuggable (e.g., you can
						set breakpoints and single-step into them).

resolve_name_start                     <DNS.LIB>

SYNTAX: int resolve_name_start(const char* hostname);

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, dns, ip address

DESCRIPTION:   Starts the process of resolving a host name into an IP address.
               The given host name is limited to DNS_MAX_NAME characters, which
               is 64 by default (63 characters + the NULL terminator). If a
               default domain is to be added, then the two strings together are
               limited to DNS_MAX_NAME.

               If <hostname> does not contain a '.' then the default domain
               (MY_DOMAIN), if provided, is appended to <hostname>. If
               <hostname> with the appended default domain does not exist,
               <hostname> is tried by itself. If that also fails, the
               lookup fails.

               If <hostname> contains a '.' then it is looked up by itself.
               If it does not exist, the default domain is appended, and that
               combination is tried. If that also fails, the lookup fails.

               If <hostname> ends with a '.', then the default
               domain is never appended. The host name is considered
               "fully qualified." The lookup is attempted without the ending '.'
               and if that fails no other combinations are attempted.

					If DNS_ENABLE_REVERSE_LOOKUP is defined and <hostname> ends
					with '.in-addr.arpa.', it is a PTR query (reverse DNS lookup of
					IP address to hostname).  You must register a callback (using
					the set_dns_ptr_callback function) to receive the parsed PTR
					response.

               This function returns a handle that must be used in the
               subsequent resolve_name_check() and resolve_cancel() functions.

PARAMETER1: 	host name to convert to an IP address

RETURN VALUE:  > 0	handle for subsequest resolve_name_* calls
					RESOLVE_NOENTRIES		could not start the resolve
						process because there were no resolve entries free
					RESOLVE_LONGHOSTNAME	the given hostname was too large
					RESOLVE_NONAMESERVER	no nameserver defined

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, dns, ip address

DESCRIPTION: 	Register a callback to receive results of PTR queries (reverse
					DNS lookups).

					The callback function should be declared in your program with
					the following prototype:

						void user_handler (longword ip, char far *hostname);

					Then use resolve_name_start to send the PTR queries.  For the
					IP address 1.2.3.4, you need to resolve the hostname
					"4.3.2.1.in-addr.arpa.".

					When the DNS library parses the PTR response, it will pass
					the IP address and hostname to your callback function.

					You must define DNS_ENABLE_REVERSE_LOOKUP to use this function.

PARAMETER1: 	Address of callback function to register or NULL to deregister
					the current callback.

RETURN VALUE:  None
