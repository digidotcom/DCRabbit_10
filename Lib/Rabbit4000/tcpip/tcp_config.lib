/* START FUNCTION DESCRIPTION ********************************************
TCPCONFIG										<TCP_CONFIG.LIB>

Description:
	Most of our networking samples can be run over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or PPP.
	This set of instructions will explain how to configure the sample
	programs for your network setup.

	Compile-time configuration is performed by defining specific macros.
	These macros can either be defined within the sample program or within
	the Defines window.  You can find the Defines window by selecting
	the Options menu, then Project Options, then the Defines tab.  Using
	the Defines window is demonstrated later in these instructions.  If you
	define the macros within your program, note that they need to be
	defined before the #use "dcrtcp.lib" line.

Ethernet (and basic TCP/IP) Configuration
-----------------------------------------
	Ethernet uses some basic TCP/IP network configuration.  Wi-Fi uses
	these parameters as well, although Wi-Fi has some unique configuration
	that is covered in a later section of these instructions.

	*** EXAMPLES ***

	   Static Configuration
	   --------------------
	   See the examples below to create a static Ethernet network
	   configuration for your Rabbit device.  A description of the
	   configuration macros follows the Examples section.

   	To configure within your program, copy and paste the following into
	   your sample program and modify as necessary for your situation:

	      #define TCPCONFIG           1
	      #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP  "10.10.6.100"
	      #define _PRIMARY_NETMASK    "255.255.255.0"
	      #define MY_GATEWAY          "10.10.6.1"
	      #define MY_NAMESERVER       "10.10.6.1"

	   Alternatively, you can configure within the Defines window.  This
	   way, you can run many of the sample programs without modification.
	   Here is an example--copy and paste into the Defines window and
	   modify as necessary:

	      TCPCONFIG          = 1;
	      _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP = "10.10.6.100";
	      _PRIMARY_NETMASK   = "255.255.255.0";
	      MY_GATEWAY         = "10.10.6.1";
	      MY_NAMESERVER      = "10.10.6.1";

		To have the Rabbit automatically select an available link-local address
		(in the range 169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255) on a local-only network
		(no gateway to other networks), use the following defines:

			C source code:
	         #define USE_LINKLOCAL
	         #define TCPCONFIG				1
	         #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP	"169.254.0.0"
	         #define _PRIMARY_NETMASK	"255.255.0.0"
	         #define MY_GATEWAY			"0.0.0.0"
	         #define MY_NAMESERVER		"0.0.0.0"

			Project defines:
	         USE_LINKLOCAL
	         TCPCONFIG				= 1
	         _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP	= "169.254.0.0"
	         _PRIMARY_NETMASK		= "255.255.0.0"
	         MY_GATEWAY				= "0.0.0.0"
	         MY_NAMESERVER			= "0.0.0.0"

	   DHCP (Dynamic) Configuration
	   ----------------------------
	   For DHCP configuration, your Rabbit device will automatically
	   discover the network parameters from a DHCP server.  This means that
	   you will need a DHCP server on your local network to use this
	   configuration method.  DHCP configuration is very simple; see the
	   examples below as well as the description of the TCPCONFIG macro.

	   To configure within your program, copy and paste the following into
	   your sample program and modify as necessary for your situation:

	      #define TCPCONFIG 5

	   Alternatively, you can configure within the Defines window.  This
	   way, you can run many of the sample programs without modification.
	   Here is an example--copy and paste into the Defines window and
	   modify as necessary:

	      TCPCONFIG = 5;

		To fall back on using a randomly-selected link-local address if a
		DHCP server is not available, define the following macros:

			C source code:
	         #define USE_LINKLOCAL
	         #define TCPCONFIG				7
	         #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP	"169.254.0.0"
	         #define _PRIMARY_NETMASK	"255.255.0.0"
	         #define MY_GATEWAY			"0.0.0.0"
	         #define MY_NAMESERVER		"0.0.0.0"

			Project defines:
	         USE_LINKLOCAL
	         TCPCONFIG				= 7
	         _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP	= "169.254.0.0"
	         _PRIMARY_NETMASK		= "255.255.0.0"
	         MY_GATEWAY				= "0.0.0.0"
	         MY_NAMESERVER			= "0.0.0.0"

	*** DESCRIPTION ***

   	To configure your Rabbit device for an Ethernet network connection,
   	you will need to define a number of macros.  As shown in the
   	Examples section above, these can be defined in either the C
   	program or the Defines window.  These macros are defined below:

	   TCPCONFIG
	      Define to 1 for a static address configuration.  Define to 5 for
	      a DHCP (dynamic) address configuration.  Define to 7 for DHCP
			with a fallback to a static address if no DHCP server is available.

	      A complete list of TCPCONFIG values and their meanings is given later
	      in these instructions.  If this is defined in the Defines window, you
	      may get a warning about a macro redefinition; this can be safely
	      ignored as the Defines window value will be used.

	   _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP   (default "10.10.6.100")
	      The desired static IP address for your Rabbit device, e.g.
	      "10.10.6.100".  Note that the quotes are necessary.  If TCPCONFIG
	      is set to 7, this address is used as the fallback address if a
	      DHCP server is unavailable.

	      If USE_LINKLOCAL is defined and _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP is set to
	      an address with 169.254 as the starting octets (e.g., "169.254.0.0"),
	      the Rabbit will randomly select an unused address in the range
	      169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255.

	      If _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP is set to a valid link-local address (169.254.1.0
	      to 169.254.254.255), the Rabbit will only select a random address if
	      that preferred address is not available.

	   _PRIMARY_NETMASK     (default "255.255.255.0")
	      The desired netmask for your Rabbit device, e.g. "255.255.255.0".

	   MY_GATEWAY           (default "10.10.6.1")
	      The gateway IP address for your Rabbit device.  This is needed if
	      you want your Rabbit device to be able to communicate with remote
	      networks--the gateway is the server that is responsible for
	      routing to other networks.  The gateway is sometimes called a
	      default router.

	   MY_NAMESERVER        (default "10.10.6.1")
	      The nameserver's IP address for your Rabbit device.  This is only
	      used if you need to resolve domain names, e.g. resolving
	      "www.digi.com" to "66.77.174.69".


Wi-Fi Configuration
-------------------
	Wi-Fi has some specific configuration parameters.  These parameters are
	covered in this section.  The basic TCP/IP parameters covered in the
	above section are also used for Wi-Fi, so please see the Ethernet and
	basic TCP/IP parameters section above for more information.  Also note
	that a Wi-Fi interface can be configured for DHCP support as well; the
	examples in this section will show only static configuration.

   *** EXAMPLES ***

	   Infrastructure, Open (no encryption) Configuration
	   --------------------------------------------------
	   The simplest way to configure a Wi-Fi network interface is to use an
	   open configuration.  This means that no encryption or authentication
	   is used.  This example is configured for infrastructure mode, which
	   means that you will also need a Wi-Fi access point or Wi-Fi router.
	   Note that your wireless access point will need to match these
	   settings (in particular, the SSID, or network name, must be the
	   same, and the AP must not have encryption enabled).

      To configure within your program, copy and paste the following into
      your sample program and modify as necessary for your situation:

         #define TCPCONFIG            1
         #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP   "10.10.6.100"
         #define _PRIMARY_NETMASK     "255.255.255.0"
         #define MY_GATEWAY           "10.10.6.1"
         #define MY_NAMESERVER        "10.10.6.1"
         #define IFC_WIFI_SSID        "rabbitTest"
         #define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE 1
         #define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS 20
         #define IFC_WIFI_MODE        IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE
         #define IFC_WIFI_REGION      IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS
         #define IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION  IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_NONE

      Alternatively, you can configure within the Defines window.  This
      way, you can run many of the sample programs without modification.
      Here is an example--copy and paste into the Defines window and
      modify as necessary:

         TCPCONFIG            = 1;
         _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP   = "10.10.6.100";
         _PRIMARY_NETMASK     = "255.255.255.0";
         MY_GATEWAY           = "10.10.6.1";
         MY_NAMESERVER        = "10.10.6.1";
         IFC_WIFI_SSID        = "rabbitTest";
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE = 1;
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS = 20;
         IFC_WIFI_MODE        = IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE;
         IFC_WIFI_REGION      = IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS;
         IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION  = IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_NONE;

		Ad-hoc, Open (no encryption) Configuration
		------------------------------------------
		Another simple way to configure a Wi-Fi network interface is to use
		an open configuration in ad-hoc mode.  An ad-hoc Wi-Fi network does
		not require an access point or Wi-Fi router to operate.  Instead,
		the Wi-Fi devices communicate directly with each other.  This is
		useful for an isolated Wi-Fi network, but it is not typically used
		when devices need to communicate outside of their own network.  Note
		that all Wi-Fi devices on an ad-hoc network need to match these
		settings (in particular, the SSID and the channel number must be the
		same).

      To configure within your program, copy and paste the following into
      your sample program and modify as necessary for your situation:

         #define TCPCONFIG             1
         #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP    "10.10.6.100"
         #define _PRIMARY_NETMASK      "255.255.255.0"
         #define MY_GATEWAY            "10.10.6.1"
         #define MY_NAMESERVER         "10.10.6.1"
         #define IFC_WIFI_SSID         "rabbitTest"
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  1
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS  20
         #define IFC_WIFI_CHANNEL      1
         #define IFC_WIFI_MODE         IFPARAM_WIFI_ADHOC
         #define IFC_WIFI_REGION       IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS
         #define IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION   IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_NONE

      Alternatively, you can configure within the Defines window.  This
      way, you can run many of the sample programs without modification.
      Here is an example--copy and paste into the Defines window and
      modify as necessary:

         TCPCONFIG             = 1;
         _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP    = "10.10.6.100";
         _PRIMARY_NETMASK      = "255.255.255.0";
         MY_GATEWAY            = "10.10.6.1";
         MY_NAMESERVER         = "10.10.6.1";
         IFC_WIFI_SSID         = "rabbitTest";
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  = 1;
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS = 20;
         IFC_WIFI_CHANNEL      = 1;
         IFC_WIFI_MODE         = IFPARAM_WIFI_ADHOC;
         IFC_WIFI_REGION       = IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS;
         IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION   = IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_NONE;

      Note that currently, the only supported encryption setting for ad-hoc
      mode is IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_NONE.

		Infrastructure, WEP Encryption Configuration
		--------------------------------------------
		WEP is a type of encryption for Wi-Fi networks.  It is now
		considered insecure, but it is commonly supported by Wi-Fi devices.
		To use WEP, all devices including the access point or Wi-Fi router
		will need to be configured with the same WEP keys (and, of course,
		the same SSID).  WEP allows multiple keys to be defined; all devices
		will need to be configured to use the same key.

      To configure within your program, copy and paste the following into
      your sample program and modify as necessary for your situation:

         #define TCPCONFIG                1
         #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP       "10.10.6.100"
         #define _PRIMARY_NETMASK         "255.255.255.0"
         #define MY_GATEWAY               "10.10.6.1"
         #define MY_NAMESERVER            "10.10.6.1"
         #define IFC_WIFI_SSID            "rabbitTest"
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  	1
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS  20
         #define IFC_WIFI_MODE            IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE
         #define IFC_WIFI_REGION          IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS
         #define IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION      IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_WEP
         #define IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEYNUM      0
         #define IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY0_HEXSTR "0123456789abcdef0123456789"

      (alternate method to define a WEP key:)

         #define IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY0_BIN   \
         	0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab,0xcd, 0xef, 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89

      Alternatively, you can configure within the Defines window.  This
      way, you can run many of the sample programs without modification.
      Here is an example--copy and paste into the Defines window and
      modify as necessary:

         TCPCONFIG                = 1;
         _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP       = "10.10.6.100";
         _PRIMARY_NETMASK         = "255.255.255.0";
         MY_GATEWAY               = "10.10.6.1";
         MY_NAMESERVER            = "10.10.6.1";
         IFC_WIFI_SSID            = "rabbitTest";
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  	 = 1;
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS = 20;
         IFC_WIFI_MODE            = IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE;
         IFC_WIFI_REGION          = IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS;
         IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION      = IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_WEP;
         IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEYNUM      = 0;
         IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY0_HEXSTR = "0123456789abcdef0123456789";

		(alternate method to define a WEP key:)

         IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY0_BIN = 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef, 0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89;

		Infrastructure, WPA/TKIP Encryption Configuration, Pre-shared Key
		-----------------------------------------------------------------
		TKIP (often called "WPA Encryption) is an encryption method for
		Wi-Fi networks.  It is considered much more secure than WEP and is
		commonly available.  The Rabbit Wi-Fi driver supports TKIP/WPA
		encryption with Pre-Shared Keys (PSK).  These keys can be specified
		as a 256-bit key or as a passphrase that is expanded into a key.
		Note that the code for this encryption method is not compiled unless
		you define the macro WIFI_USE_WPA.

      To configure within your program, copy and paste the following into
      your sample program and modify as necessary for your situation:

         #define TCPCONFIG             1
         #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP    "10.10.6.100"
         #define _PRIMARY_NETMASK      "255.255.255.0"
         #define MY_GATEWAY            "10.10.6.1"
         #define MY_NAMESERVER         "10.10.6.1"
         #define WIFI_USE_WPA
         #define IFC_WIFI_SSID         "rabbitTest"
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  1
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS  20
         #define IFC_WIFI_MODE         IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE
         #define IFC_WIFI_REGION       IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS
         #define IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION   IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_TKIP

      Alternatively, you can configure within the Defines window.  This
      way, you can run many of the sample programs without modification.
      Here is an example--copy and paste into the Defines window and
      modify as necessary:

         TCPCONFIG                = 1;
         _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP       = "10.10.6.100";
         _PRIMARY_NETMASK         = "255.255.255.0";
         MY_GATEWAY               = "10.10.6.1";
         MY_NAMESERVER            = "10.10.6.1";
         WIFI_USE_WPA;
         IFC_WIFI_SSID            = "rabbitTest";
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  	 = 1;
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS = 20;
         IFC_WIFI_MODE            = IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE;
         IFC_WIFI_REGION          = IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS;
         IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION      = IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_TKIP;

      Note: For setting the WPA Pre-Shared Key (PSK) info see the
      "WPA Pre-Shared Key (PSK)" section below.

      Infrastructure, WPA2/CCMP Encryption Configuration, Pre-shared Key
		------------------------------------------------------------------
      WPA2 is a more secure replacement for WEP.  This implementation
   	uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) based algorithm, also known
   	as CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication
   	Code Protocol) cypher suite. The Rabbit Wi-Fi driver supports CCMP/WPA2
		encryption with Pre-Shared Keys (PSK). These keys can be specified
		as a 256-bit key or as a passphrase that is expanded into a key.
		Note that the code for this encryption method is not compiled unless
		you define the macros WIFI_USE_WPA and WIFI_AES_ENABLED.

      To configure within your program, copy and paste the following into
      your sample program and modify as necessary for your situation:

         #define TCPCONFIG             1
         #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP    "10.10.6.100"
         #define _PRIMARY_NETMASK      "255.255.255.0"
         #define MY_GATEWAY            "10.10.6.1"
         #define MY_NAMESERVER         "10.10.6.1"
         #define WIFI_USE_WPA
         #define WIFI_AES_ENABLED
         #define IFC_WIFI_SSID         "rabbitTest"
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  1
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS  20
         #define IFC_WIFI_MODE         IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE
         #define IFC_WIFI_REGION       IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS
         #define IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION   IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_CCMP

      Alternatively, you can configure within the Defines window.  This
      way, you can run many of the sample programs without modification.
      Here is an example--copy and paste into the Defines window and
      modify as necessary:

         TCPCONFIG                = 1;
         _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP       = "10.10.6.100";
         _PRIMARY_NETMASK         = "255.255.255.0";
         MY_GATEWAY               = "10.10.6.1";
         MY_NAMESERVER            = "10.10.6.1";
         WIFI_USE_WPA;
         WIFI_AES_ENABLED;
         IFC_WIFI_SSID            = "rabbitTest";
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  	 = 1;
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS = 20;
         IFC_WIFI_MODE            = IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE;
         IFC_WIFI_REGION          = IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS;
         IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION      = IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_CCMP;

      Note: For setting the WPA Pre-Shared Key (PSK) info see the
      "WPA Pre-Shared Key (PSK)" section below.

      WPA Pre-Shared Key (PSK)
      ------------------------
      When using WPA/TKIP or WPA2/CCMP, you will also need to define the WPA
      Pre-Shared Key (PSK).  This can be done by specifying a passphrase that
      the driver will expand to a 256-bit key or by specifying the 256-bit
      key itself.  Note that expanding a passphrase takes a significant
      amount of time at startup--up to about 20 seconds.

      To specify the WPA passphrase, you will need something like the
      following:

         #define IFC_WIFI_WPA_PSK_PASSPHRASE "myPassphrase"

      To specify the WPA Pre-Shared Key itself, use the following:

         #define IFC_WIFI_WPA_PSK_HEXSTR \
         	"1122334455667788990011223344556677889900112233445566778899001122"

      To specify the WPA passphrase in the Project Defines window, use the
      following:

         IFC_WIFI_WPA_PSK_PASSPHRASE = "myPassphrase";

      To specify the WPA Pre-Shared Key itself, use the following:

         IFC_WIFI_WPA_PSK_HEXSTR = "1122334455667788990011223344556677889900112233445566778899001122";

		Infrastructure, WPA Enterprise using EAP/TLS and CCMP Encryption
		-----------------------------------------------------------------
      To configure within your program, copy and paste the following into
      your sample program and modify as necessary for your situation:

         #define TCPCONFIG             1
         #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP    "10.10.6.100"
         #define _PRIMARY_NETMASK      "255.255.255.0"
         #define MY_GATEWAY            "10.10.6.1"
         #define MY_NAMESERVER         "10.10.6.1"
         #define WIFI_USE_WPA
         #define WIFI_AES_ENABLED
         #define IFC_WIFI_SSID         "rabbitTest"
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  1
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS  20
         #define IFC_WIFI_MODE         IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE
         #define IFC_WIFI_REGION       IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS
         #define IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION   IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_CCMP
			// <- the above defines are identical to using CCMP with PSK

	      #define WPA_USE_EAP     		WPA_USE_EAP_TLS
	      #define IFC_WIFI_WPA_PROTOCOL IFPARAM_WIFI_WPA_PROTOCOL_WPA2
	      #define IFC_WIFI_IDENTITY     "userid"
	      #ximport "certs/root.pem"           root_ca_cert
	      #ximport "certs/my_client.pem"      my_client_cert
	      #define IFC_WIFI_CLIENT_CERT_XIM    my_client_cert, my_client_cert
	      #define IFC_WIFI_CA_CERT_XIM        root_ca_cert

      Because it is necessary to ximport SSL certificates for use with this
      encryption method, it isn't possible to completely configure WPA
      Enterprise with EAP/TLS and CCMP using the Project Defines.

      Provided you include these two ximports in your program:

	      #ximport "certs/root.pem"           root_ca_cert
	      #ximport "certs/my_client.pem"      my_client_cert

      you can provide the rest of the configuration in the Project Defines.
      Here is an example--copy and paste into the Defines window and
      modify as necessary:

         TCPCONFIG                = 1;
         _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP       = "10.10.6.100";
         _PRIMARY_NETMASK         = "255.255.255.0";
         MY_GATEWAY               = "10.10.6.1";
         MY_NAMESERVER            = "10.10.6.1";
         WIFI_USE_WPA;
         WIFI_AES_ENABLED;
         IFC_WIFI_SSID            = "rabbitTest";
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  	 = 1;
			IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS = 20;
         IFC_WIFI_MODE            = IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE;
         IFC_WIFI_REGION          = IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS;
         IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION      = IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_CCMP;

	      WPA_USE_EAP     		    = WPA_USE_EAP_TLS;
	      IFC_WIFI_WPA_PROTOCOL    = IFPARAM_WIFI_WPA_PROTOCOL_WPA2;
	      IFC_WIFI_IDENTITY        = "userid";
	      IFC_WIFI_CLIENT_CERT_XIM = my_client_cert, my_client_cert;
	      IFC_WIFI_CA_CERT_XIM     = root_ca_cert;

	   NOTE: when using certificates (which are required in one form or
	   another for any WPA Enterprise configuration), it is very important
	   that the Real-Time Clock (RTC) on the Rabbit is set to the correct
	   date.  This is because certificates are always checked for their
	   validity period, which is expressed as calendar dates.  If the RTC
	   is not set correctly, then association may fail, and it is not always
	   obvious that this is the cause.  When testing your application, you can
	     #define X509_NO_RTC_AVAILABLE
	   at the top of your application in order to bypass the date-based
	   validity checks.

		Infrastructure, WPA Enterprise using PEAP and TKIP Encryption
		-----------------------------------------------------------------
      To configure within your program, copy and paste the following into
      your sample program and modify as necessary for your situation:

         #define TCPCONFIG             1
         #define _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP    "10.10.6.100"

         #define MY_NAMESERVER         "10.10.6.1"
         #define WIFI_USE_WPA
         #define IFC_WIFI_SSID         "rabbitTest"
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE  1
			#define IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS  20
         #define IFC_WIFI_MODE         IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE
         #define IFC_WIFI_REGION       IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS
         #define IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION   IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_TKIP
			// <- the above defines are identical to using TKIP with PSK
	      #define WPA_USE_EAP     		WPA_USE_EAP_PEAP
	      #define IFC_WIFI_IDENTITY     "my_user1d"
	      #define IFC_WIFI_PASSWORD     "my_passw0rd"
	      #ximport "certs/root.pem"           root_ca_cert
	      #define IFC_WIFI_CA_CERT_XIM        root_ca_cert
	      #define IFC_WIFI_CLIENT_CERT_XIM    0L,0L

	   The last parameter is explicitly setting the client certificate to
	   "none".  This is because client certificates are normally not
	   used with PEAP authentication.

      Alternatively, you can configure within the Defines window.  This
      way, you can run many of the sample programs without modification.
      Here is an example--copy and paste into the Defines window and
      modify as necessary:

         TCPCONFIG                = 1;
         _PRIMARY_STATIC_IP       = "10.10.6.100";
         _PRIMARY_NETMASK         = "255.255.255.0";
         MY_GATEWAY               = "10.10.6.1";
         MY_NAMESERVER            = "10.10.6.1";
         WIFI_USE_WPA;

         IFC_WIFI_MODE            = IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE;
         IFC_WIFI_REGION          = IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS;
         IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION      = IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_TKIP;

	      WPA_USE_EAP     		    = WPA_USE_EAP_PEAP;
	      IFC_WIFI_IDENTITY        = "my_user1d";
	      IFC_WIFI_PASSWORD        = "my_passw0rd";
	      IFC_WIFI_CA_CERT_XIM     = root_ca_cert;
	      IFC_WIFI_CLIENT_CERT_XIM = 0L,0L;

	   Note that #ximport cannot be directly specified in the project
	   options box; it needs to be inserted in the project code e.g. as

	      #ximport "certs/root.pem"           root_ca_cert


	*** DESCRIPTION ***

   	To configure your Rabbit device for a Wi-Fi network connection, you
   	will need to define a number of macros.  As shown in the	Examples
   	section above, these can be defined in either the C program or the
   	Defines window.  Note that the macros in the Ethernet section (above
   	the Wi-Fi section) apply for Wi-Fi devices as well.  This section
   	only covers the macros specific to Wi-Fi.  These macros are defined
   	below:

	   TCPCONFIG
	   	This macro works the same for a Wi-Fi interface as it does for an
	   	Ethernet interface.  Use the value 1 for a static TCP/IP network
	   	configuration, or 5 for a DHCP (dynamic) configuration.

		IFC_WIFI_SSID          (default "rabbitTest")
			This is the SSID (Service Set Identifier) or name of the wireless
			network that you want your Rabbit device to connect to.  All
			other devices on your wireless network (including your access
			point or wireless router) must have this same name.

		IFC_WIFI_ROAM_ENABLE		(default 1)
         This turns roaming on or off

		IFC_WIFI_ROAM_BEACON_MISS	(default 20)
      	This sets the number of beacons that are missed continuously in order
         for scanning for a better access point and subsequent association to
         take place.

		IFC_WIFI_MODE          (default IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE)
			Specifies the network architecture mode for your wireless network.
			This macro has two possible values.  IFPARAM_WIFI_INFRASTRUCTURE
         means that the device will attach to an infrastructure network.  An
			infrastructure network includes at least one access point that
			coordinates communication on the wireless network.  IFPARAM_WIFI_ADHOC
			means that the device will use an ad-hoc mode network.  An ad-hoc
			network does not have an access point; all devices on the wireless
			network simply communicate directly with each other.

		IFC_WIFI_CHANNEL
         Sets the channel (0, or 1 - 14*) to use.  Mandatory for an ad-hoc
         network, it should usually be 0 (automatic) for infrastructure mode.
         Valid channels depend on the region selected by IFC_WIFI_REGION.

		IFC_WIFI_REGION   (default IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS)
			This macro sets the channel range and maximum power limit for the
			region selected.  Different regions have different regulations on
			Wi-Fi communication.  This macro can have the values:

   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AMERICAS           Americas, including the US (ch. 1-11)
   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_AUSTRALIA				Australia (ch. 1-11)
   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_CANADA					Canada (ch. 1-11)
   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_CHINA					China (ch. 1-11)
   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_EMEA					Europe, Middle East, Africa (ch. 1-13)
   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_FRANCE					France (ch. 10-13)
   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_ISRAEL					Israel (ch. 3-11)
   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_JAPAN					Japan (ch. 1-13)
   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_MEXICO_INDOORS		Mexico indoors (ch. 1-11)
   IFPARAM_WIFI_REGION_MEXICO_OUTDOORS		Mexico outdoors (ch. 9-11)

         See the IFS_WIFI_REGION section of the ifconfig() function help for
			more information.

		IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION     (default IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_NONE)
			This macro controls the type of encryption used.  It accepts a
         combination (with multiple values ORed together) of the following
         values:

         IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_ANY			Use any type of encryption
         IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_NONE			No encryption used
         IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_WEP			Use WEP encryption (see below to set keys)

         If you define WIFI_USE_WPA, you can use this value as well:

         IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_TKIP			Use TKIP encryption (WPA)

			If you define both WIFI_USE_WPA and WIFI_AES_ENABLED, you can use:

         IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_CCMP			Use CCMP encryption (WPA2)

         Note that currently, the only supported encryption setting for
         ad-hoc mode is IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_NONE.

			Use of IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION with either TKIP or CCMP:
			----------------------------------------------------
			When it is desired to associate with an AP which supports either WPA
			or WPA-2 (i.e. TKIP or CCMP), it is necessary to explicitly allow
			both forms of encryption i.e.
				#define IFC_WIFI_ENCRYPTION  \
     				IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_CCMP | IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_TKIP

			If you don't allow TKIP, then it is not possible to agree on an
			acceptable group transient key.  In summary, use the above bitwise
			OR of the two encryption settings when defining the encryption suite.
			This will work also with APs set to just use CCMP.  If an AP is set
			to just TKIP, then don't use IFPARAM_WIFI_ENCR_CCMP otherwise it will
			not associate, since it would not be correct to allow association
			with a theoretically weaker form of protection (TKIP) when a stronger
			protection (CCMP) was specified.


		IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEYNUM       (default 0)
			Select the WEP key to use when using WEP encryption.  This can
			have the value 0, 1, 2, or 3.  See the WEP key macros description
         below -- one or more of these macros need to be defined as well.

		IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY0_BIN
		IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY1_BIN
		IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY2_BIN
		IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY3_BIN
		   (defaults to undefined)
			Specifies the WEP keys to use for WEP encryption.  These keys
			can be either 40-bit or 104-bit (i.e., 5 bytes or 13 bytes).
			These must be defined as a comma-separated list of byte values.
			Note that you do not necessarily need to define all four WEP
			keys.  You can typically just define one key, make sure it matches
			the key used on all other devices, and set IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEYNUM
			to point to the correct key.

		IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY0_HEXSTR
		IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY1_HEXSTR
		IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY2_HEXSTR
		IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY3_HEXSTR
		   (defaults to undefined)
			Specifies the WEP keys to use for WEP encryption.  These keys
			can be either 40-bit or 104-bit (i.e., a string of either 10 or 26
         hex characters).
			Note that you do not necessarily need to define all four WEP
			keys.  You can typically just define one key, make sure it matches
			the key used on all other devices, and set IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEYNUM
			to point to the correct key.

         If both IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY#_HEXSTR and IFC_WIFI_WEP_KEY#_BIN are
         defined for a particular key, the HEX version will be used.

		WIFI_USE_WPA
			Define this macro to compile WPA functionality into the Wi-Fi
			driver.  This is necessary to enable TKIP encryption.  Because
			the WPA code has a significant size, it is not compiled by
			default.

      IFC_WIFI_WPA_PSK_PASSPHRASE
			TKIP/WPA encryption requires a passphrase or a key.  This macro
			allows you to define a passphrase with an ASCII string.  The
			Wi-Fi driver will expand the passphrase into a key using a
			standard algorithm.  This process takes up to about 20 seconds.
			The same passphrase must be configured on all devices on the
			same Wi-Fi network.

         If possible, you should use IFC_WIFI_WPA_PSK_HEXSTR instead of
         IFC_WIFI_WPA_PSK_PASSPHRASE to set the key.

		IFC_WIFI_WPA_PSK_HEXSTR
			Instead of a passphrase, you can specify a key directly for
			TKIP/WPA encryption.  The key must be given as a series of hex
			digits within an ASCII string.  The key must be 256 bits, or 64
			hex digits.  Specifying the key directly means that a passphrase
			does not need to be expanded, resulting in a faster startup time.

	   WPA_USE_EAP
	   	Set to a bitwise OR combination of the following:
	   		WPA_USE_EAP_TLS
	   		WPA_USE_EAP_PEAP
	   	which specifies the enterprise authentication method to use,
	   	currently either EAP/TLS or EAP/PEAP/MSCHAPv2 respectively.
	   	Use of this macro will bring in a lot of library code so support
	   	enterprise level authentication and key management.  This will
	   	require configuration of the access point as well as a
	   	separate machine to be used as an Authentication Server (e.g.
	   	Radius server).

	  IFC_WIFI_WPA_PROTOCOL
	  		Set to bitwise OR of
	  			IFPARAM_WIFI_WPA_PROTOCOL_WPA2
	  			IFPARAM_WIFI_WPA_PROTOCOL_WPA
	  		in order to support WPA2 (RSN, Robust Security Network i.e. with CCMP)
	  		or WPA (the original TKIP-based Wifi Protected Access).

     IFC_WIFI_CLIENT_CERT_XIM    my_client_cert, my_client_key
			Set to two parameters: first parameter is public certificate of
			this (client) machine for EAP/TLS.  Second parameter is for
			the corresponding private key.  These are generally #ximported
			files, which are the .der or .pem certificate/private key files.
			Currently, the private key file must *not* itself be encrypted.
			This is only used for EAP/TLS.

			Note: if certificates have been generated by the Rabbit Certificate
			Utility, then you should #ximport the <basename>s.pem and
			<basename>key.pem files, where <basename> is the file name you
			selected for the client certificate.  For example, if the file
			name was "client" then
			  #ximport "certs/clients.pem" my_client_cert
			  #ximport "certs/clientkey.pem" my_client_key

	  IFC_WIFI_CA_CERT_XIM        root_ca_cert
	  		Set to the #ximported file containing the trusted certificate
	  		authority for validating the Authentication Server's public
	  		certificate.  This may be a .pem or .der format file.
			This is used for EAP/TLS, and should also be used for PEAP since PEAP
			uses TLS "under the covers".  In either case, it is important to
			be able to verify the authenticity of the Authentication Server
			itself.  This is done by having the trusted CA certificate available.

			Note: if you generated your own Certificate Authority (CA) using the
			Rabbit Certificate Utility, then you should #ximport the
			<basename>.der or <basename>.pem file for the CA.  For example, if the
			file name was "my_ca" then
			  #ximport "private/my_ca.der" root_ca_cert

	  IFC_WIFI_IDENTITY     "my_user1d"
			Define an identity for PEAP.  Using this macro sets both the
			inner and outer identity to the same value.  If your application
			requires a different outer "plaintext" identity, then your application
			will need to use the ifconfig() function directly.

			This is also required for EAP-TLS.  The userID may be set to a
			dummy value, depending on the requirements of the Authentication
			Server.

	  IFC_WIFI_PASSWORD     "my_passw0rd"
			Define a password for PEAP.  Not used for EAP-TLS.



	*** DESCRIPTION:  FURTHER WI-FI MACROS ***

   	A few other Wi-Fi compile-time configuration macros are available
   	that were not used in the examples above.  These macros are
   	described here:

		IFC_WIFI_AUTHENTICATION     (default depends on other macros)
			Specifies the authentication mode to use for this Wi-Fi network.

			Note that the default for this parameter depends on whether
			WPA_USE_EAP is defined.  If defined to zero, the default for this
			parameter is IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_OPEN.  If WPA_USE_EAP is defined to
			non-zero, then the default is IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_WPA_8021X.
			Otherwise if WPA_USE_EAP is not defined then, for backward
			compatibility only, the default is IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_ANY.

			The IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_ANY default is not now recommended; instead,
			the application should explicitly set this parameter to the desired
			authentication method, since that will promote upward compatibility.

			It accepts a combination (with multiple values ORed together) of the
         following values:

	         IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_ANY
	         								use any method.
                                    Don't use this when using EAP
                                    authentication.  Always set to one of
                                    the following, as appropriate.
	         IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_OPEN
	         								use open authentication
	         IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_SHAREDKEY
	         								use WEP shared-key authentication

         If you define WIFI_USE_WPA, you can use this value as well:

	         IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_WPA_PSK
	         								use WPA pre-shared key (TKIP, CCMP)

         If you define WPA_USE_EAP, you can use the following value as well.
         Note that in this case, do not use IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_ANY, and do not
         OR in a number of different values.  Select the appropriate
         authentication method explicitly, otherwise network performance
         will be degraded.

        		IFPARAM_WIFI_AUTH_WPA_8021X
        										WPA with 802.1X (EAP) authentication.

		IFC_WIFI_FRAG_THRESHOLD   (default 0)
			Set the fragmentation threshold.  Frames (or packets) that are
			larger than this threshold are split into multiple fragments.
			This can be useful on busy or noisy networks.  The value can be
			between 256 and 2346, or 0 which means no fragmentation.

		IFC_WIFI_RTS_THRESHOLD    (default 2347, no RTS/CTS)
			Set the RTS threshold, the frame size at which the RTS/CTS
			mechanism is used.  This is sometimes useful on busy or noisy
			networks.  The value can be between 1 and 2347.

PPP Configuration
-----------------
	PPP Configuration is a complex topic and is highly dependent on the
	serial port(s) used, the method of connecting to the PPP server, etc.
	Complete details are outside the scope of these instructions; please
	see the User's Manual for the PPP module for more information.

	A predefined PPP configuration can be used by defining TCPCONFIG to 8.
	This configuration makes a number of assumptions:  serial port B will
	be used, hardware flow control will be used, etc.  These assumptions
	will need to be modified for your specific situation.  Search for the
	section within TCP_CONFIG.LIB that begins with this line:

	#if TCPCONFIG == 8

	This section defines the configuration settings for a TCPCONFIG value
	of 8.  See the documentation for ifconfig() for more information on
	the settings here.  You can make changes directly if you would like,
	or you can use the custom config method which is detailed later in
	these instructions.

PPPoE Configuration
-------------------
	PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet) configuration is not covered by the
	pre-defined TCPCONFIG configurations.  Typically, TCPCONFIG should
	be set to 0 (meaning no configuration), and the compile-time
	configuration is done within the sample program or the Defines
	window.  See the sample program Samples\PPP\pppoe_test.c for an
	example of configuring PPPoE.

Custom Configurations (custom_config.lib)
-----------------------------------------
   If TCPCONFIG is set to a number 100 or greater, then a library called
   "custom_config.lib" will be used.  This library is not distributed with
   Dynamic C; it is expected that it will be created by each user with
   appropriate test (or production) settings.  The advantage of creating
   custom_config.lib is that it will not be replaced by new releases of
   Dynamic C.

   When a new release of Dynamic C is installed, the only action necessary
   to use custom_config.lib is the addition of its location to the LIB.DIR
   file.

   custom_config.lib can be initially created, using this library file as
   a template.

   See the documentation or function help for ifconfig() for information
   about the possible configuration parameters.

TCPCONFIG Predefined Configuration Table
----------------------------------------

	The following table is an overview of the predefined TCPCONFIG
	configuration values.  Note that "Runtime" means that that value
	only allows runtime configuration.

   TCPCONFIG | Ethernet | PPP | DHCP | Runtime | Comments
             |  and/or  |     |      |         |

   ----------+----------+-----+------+---------+-------------------------------


   ** Config 8 (PPP) assumes a modem is connected to serial port B, with
      hardware flow control.  This is unlikely to work without modification.
      It is intended more as a template for setting up your own configuration.
