/* START LIBRARY DESCRIPTION *********************************************
ZSERVER.LIB

DESCRIPTION:

	Common server resource and user management functions.

   This library provides a common point of interface for TCP/IP servers,
   such as HTTP and FTP, so that various resources (files, variables
   and functions) are accessible to external clients in a uniform way.

   Many of the functions in this library are mainly intended for
   developers of new servers, and need not be considered if your application
   makes use of the servers provided with Dynamic C.  The functions which
   are commonly called by the application (mainly during the initialization
   phase) are grouped together for convenience.

   Starting with Dynamic C 8.10, this library has been upgraded to support
   the FAT filesystem, along with the existing FS2 filesystem.  These
   filesystems are supported in a more powerful, consistent and
   user-friendly manner.  In addition, there is better support for
   access control.

   The new library is fully backward-compatible with previous releases.
   Existing code should not need to be modified, or very small modifications
   may be made if it is desired to support the new FAT filesystem or
   enhance access control.  In spite of this backward compatibility, it
   is recommended that you review existing code and upgrade it to take
   advantage of the new facilities.  This will ease the process of
   upgrading to future releases.  For example, the old style of defining
   "static" resources was to initialize a constant structure called
   http_flashspec[].  Since this is rather restrictive, a new set of
   macros has been defined to make the table easier to define.  Using
   the macros also hides internal details, which gives Rabbit Semiconductor greater
   ability to make improvements.

   Virtual Filesystem Hierarchy
   ----------------------------

   Zserver supports the concept of a "virtual filesystem".  This is
   modelled on the Unix directory structure.  There is a "root
   directory" called "/".  Under this directory there are a number
   of "mount points" (which are entry points for the various
   filesystems) plus individual entries for each resource added
   statically (flash) or dynamically (RAM).

   A naming convention has been established for the sub-directories.
   The FS2 filesystem is accessed via the "/fs2" mount point.
   DOS FAT partitions are accessed from "/A", "/B", "/C" etc.
   (This was chosen to be reminiscent of DOS drive letters).

   Note that the mount point will only exist if the corresponding
   filesystem has been included prior to #use zserver.lib.  For example,
   if you #use fs2.lib, then the /fs2 mount point will be created.

   Note that resource names added using sspec_addrootfile(),
   sspec_addvariable() etc. may conflict with mount-point names.
   This is undesirable, so your application should avoid calling
   such resources by names starting with /fs2/, /A/ etc.  In
   addition, you should not use /dev or /etc either, since these
   may be used by future versions of the library.

   For backward compatibility, a resource called "/" may be created.
   When accessed by a server as a resource file, this entry will
   be returned.  Otherwise (e.g. for directory listing) the "/"
   entry will refer to the root directory.

   FS2:

   If you #use fs2.lib, then all FS2 files automatically become
   available as resource files.  Under the /fs2 mount point,
   each FS2 file is called "file1", "file2" etc.  The numeric
   suffic indicates the FS2 file number (1..255), and the
   "file" prefix is constant.  These entries will exist for
   each file which exists in FS2, whatever the FS2 extent that is
   exists in.

   In addition, under /fs2 there will be a series of subdirectories.
   These indicate the available FS2 extents.  Each extent will be
   called "/fs2/ext1", "/fs2/ext2" etc.  Alias entries also exist
   such as /fs2/ram for the first RAM extent, /fs2/flash for the
   first data flash extent, and /fs2/pflash for the program flash
   extent.

   Under each of these extent directories will be a list of all the
   files which exist on that extent.  For example, if FS2 file
   number 88 exists on the data flash, then the following three
   entries will appear to exist:

     /fs2/file88
     /fs2/flash/file88
     /fs2/ext2/file88

   All three files refer to the same actual file.  The main distinction
   applies when creating new files.  If a resource /fs2/ram/file99
   is created, then that file will be created on the RAM extent.
   If, on the other hand, /fs2/file99 is created, then that file
   will be created on an unspecified extent.  Thus, it is best to
   include the extent subdirectory when creating new resources.

   FAT:

   If you #use fat16.lib, then zserver will have access to FAT partitions.
   FAT partitions live on "devices", and each device can have up to
   4 partitions recognized by the FAT library.  Since the FAT
   filesystem has its own native file naming and directory navigation
   facility, zserver defers to this for resource names.

   The first partition will be accessible under the /A mount point.
   For example, if the first partition contains a file called
   /htdocs/admin/index.htm then the full resource name will be
   /A/htdocs/admin/index.htm.

   NOTE: FAT files are customarily accessed using backslashes in
   the path name.  Zserver requires use of forward slashes, so you
   must define the symbol FAT_USE_FORWARDSLASH before #use fat16.lib.
   Do not worry about interoperability with PCs etc., since the
   slash delimiters are not stored on the actual medium.  If you
   unmount a removable medium then mount it in a DOS or Windows
   PC, then backslashes are used in the path names, as usual.

   Note that zserver requires each FAT partition to be registered,
   otherwise its mount point will not be visible.  You can assign
   any mount point to any partition, however each mount point must
   refer to a different partition.  See the sspec_fatregister()
   function for more details.

   You can use the sspec_automount() function to simplify the
   initialization of the FAT (and/or FS2) libraries.  Otherwise,
   you need to properly initialize the library in your application
   before calling zserver functions.  See the documentation for the
   FS2 and FAT libraries for more details.

   Static and RAM resources:

   These resources live directly in the root directory.  Each
   resource may be assigned a name that may contain slashes and other
   arbitrary characters (except NULL).  If you use slashes, this does
   NOT mean that there is an implied directory hierarchy.  For example,
   if you have two resources called
     /food/bread.html  and
     /food/cheese.html
   then you cannot use sspec_cd() to "change directory" to "/food".
   There is no such directory; the resource name just happens to look
   like a file in a directory.

   Not only files, but also variables, functions, forms and other types
   of resources can be defined in the static or RAM tables.  The names of
   these resources appear in a directory listing of the root directory,
   however they are not openable using sspec_open() or other functions
   which expect file-type resources.

   Resource Access Control
   -----------------------

	Resources may be assigned various access controls, called "permissions".
   The permissions control access by servers (in general) as well as
   specific user groups.

   It is assumed that most servers will identify and authenticate a
   set of "users" i.e. external entities which want to access resources.
   Zserver.lib supports the concept of "user groups", and access control
   is specified for user groups, not individual users.

   The sauth_*() series of functions allow users to be defined and
   managed.  Each unique user ID added via sauth_adduser() has the
   following set of attributes:

   	username - a character string of up to SAUTH_MAXNAME characters.
      password - another character string up to SAUTH_MAXNAME.
      mask - a 16-bit bitmask.  Each bit which is set indicates a
             user group of which this user is a member.  This implies
             that there is a maximum of 16 user groups which can
             be defined; typically 2 or 3 would be used in a typical
             application e.g. one for ordinary users, one for an
             "administrator" and maybe one with unlimited access.
      writeaccess - another 16-bit mask.  Each bit in this mask
             indicates a server for which this user has write
             access to one or more resources.  If the bit is not
             set, then the user does not have write access from
             this server in spite of any other permission which
             may allow write access.
		servermask - this defines the set of servers for which this
      		user has any access at all.  If the bit for a server
            is not set, then this user is effectively "hidden" as
            far as that server is concerned.
      data - this is an arbitrary pointer which may be used to
      		associate additional data with this user.

   Zserver provides a basic authentication service (sauth_authenticate())
   however some servers may need to perform more sophisticated
   authentication when the user logs in.  This is left up to the
   server, since the methods are quite variable.

   Note: only the sauth_* functions are concerned with individual
   user IDs.  The sspec_* functions are only concerned with user
   groups i.e. the mask field in the userid entry.

   The mask can contain one or more bits set to '1' i.e. a user
   can be a member of one or more groups.  Typically, if a "super
   user" was defined, then that user would be a member of all
   groups.  When access tests are performed, access is granted if
   any of the user's group bits allow the specified access
   (read or write).

   By default, when you call sauth_adduser() to define a new
   userid, the mask is set to a single bit which is a '1'
   shifted left by the user's entry number in the userid table.
   If 16 or fewer users are defined in this manner, each user
   will be assigned a new, unique, group.  This is compatible
   with older versions of the library which did not have the
   concept of user groups.  In this case, users and user groups
   are considered equivalent.  You can override this behavior
   by calling the sauth_setusermask() function for any users
   where this is undesirable (e.g. to make the super user a
   member of all groups, not just its own unique group).

   Each server should have a unique bit assigned to identify that
   server.  Up to 12 servers may be defined; 4 bits in the 16-bit
   bitmask are reserved for special flags.  Some of these server
   identifiers are predefined for use by existing server libraries.
   These are:
		SERVER_HTTP			0x0001	// Web
		SERVER_FTP			0x0002	// File transfer
		SERVER_SMTP			0x0004	// Mail
		SERVER_HTTPS		0x0008	// Secure web server
		SERVER_SNMP			0x0010	// SNMP agent
		SERVER_SSL			0x0020	// SSL/TLS
		SERVER_IDIGI		0x0040	// iDigi
   Other bits are reserved for servers developed by customers:
		SERVER_USER			0x0800
		SERVER_USER2 		0x0400
   Note that the user-defined server should "grow down" to allow
   room for future Rabbit Semiconductor-supplied servers (which "grow up").

   There is also a symbol, SERVER_ANY, which can be used in place
   of a server mask when any (or all) servers are applicable.
   Otherwise, you can usually specify multiple servers by ORing
   the SERVER_* symbols together.

   Many of the new sspec_* functions require a "ServerContext"
   structure to be passed.  This is explained in greater detail
   below, however the important thing to note is that this
   structure has fields which identify the current server and
   userid.  The "server" field in ServerContext identifies the
   server, and this is one of the few cases where only a single
   server bit should be set, identifying the server.

   Having specified a set of user groups and servers, the various
   methods for setting permissions for each resource is described
   below.

   There are three basic methods for setting the permissions for
   a resource.  If the resource is defined in the flash resource
   table (e.g. using the SSPEC_RESOURCE_* macros), then the
   permissions must be set using the SSPEC_RESOURCE_P_* series
   of macros.  Such permissions cannot be changed at runtime since
   they are stored in flash.

   If the resource is defined in the RAM table, then you can use
   the sspec_setpermissions() function (and some others) to
   dynamically specify the reource permissions.

   If the resource is in the virtual filesystem hierarchy, then
   you can use the sspec_addrule() function to associate permissions
   with a resource (or set of resources with the same path name
   prefix).

   Whichever method is used, the permissions data structure is the
   same.  The fields in this structure are:

   	realm - this is an arbitrary character string which is
          associated with the resource.  The name "realm" originates
          with the HTTP server, however this string can be used
          for any purpose as required by the server.  If the realm
          string is NULL in a flash- or ram-table entry, then the
          rule table (sspec_addrule()) is consulted to obtain the
          permissions.  If the rule table has no entry for this
          resource name, then it reverts back to the flash- or ram-
          table permissions (with NULL realm).
      readgroups - this 16-bit bitmask indicates the user group(s)
      	 which are granted read access to this resource.
      writegroups - as for readgroups, except for write access.
      servermask - a bitmask of the servers which are allowed to
      	 access this resource.  For historical reasons, if this
          is set to zero, then all servers are allowed.  If at
          least one bit is set, but the server bit does not match,
          then the resource is effectively hidden from that server
          regardless of the other permissions (user groups).
      method - this is a single character bitfield which
          is set to indicate the acceptable method(s) of
          authentication required.  Currently, the following values
          are defined, however zserver does not actually make use
          of them:
            SERVER_AUTH_DEFAULT		0x00
            		// Use backward-compatible authentication (see below)
				SERVER_AUTH_NONE			0x01
            		// No authentication method specified
				SERVER_AUTH_BASIC			0x02
            		// May use plaintext userid/password matching
				SERVER_AUTH_DIGEST	  	0x04
            		// May use challenge-response type protocol
                  // (such as HTTP digest).  Note that this is only
                  // useful if USE_HTTP_DIGEST_AUTHENTICATION is
                  // also defined.
				SERVER_AUTH_PK				0x08
            		// May use public key authentication (such as SSL/TLS)
            		// This is not yet implemented; reserved for future use.
          "SERVER_AUTH_DEFAULT" (0) has the following semantics,
          which are retained from previous releases of the HTTP
          library: If sspec_needsauthentication() returns FALSE,
          then no authentication is
          required.  Otherwise, the authentication method set using
          the http_setauthentication() function is used.
		mimetype - this is a pointer to a MIMETypeMap struct.  This
          information is not strictly related to access control,
          but it is grouped with the permissions for convenience.
          If NULL, then the default table of MIME types will be
          consulted.  MIME types are explained below.

   The rule-based permissions are described in detail with the
   documentation for the sspec_addrule() function.


   Naming Conventions
   ------------------

   For mainly historical reasons, most of the function names start with
   "sspec_".  The functions associated with user and group management
   start with "sauth_".

   Most of the macros start with "SSPEC_" however, for backward compatibility,
   there are a few inconsistencies.  In particular, the HTTP server was
   treated specially by the library (HTTP pre-dated ZSERVER).  Now, HTTP
   is treated the same as any other server, but some of the names reflect
   this heritage.


DATA STRUCTURES:

	MIME Type Table
   ---------------

	Mapping for MIME (Multimedia Internet Mail Extensions) types based on
   resource name extensions.  The purpose of this structure (one or more
   of which are collected into a table called "http_types") is to associate
   resource content types with a file-type resource.  Common examples are
   "text/html" and "image/jpeg".  Typically, the association is done by
   looking at the resource name's "extension" e.g. index.html is mapped
   to "text/html" by setting the extension field to ".html" and the
   type field to "text/html".  You can also make an explicit association
   using the rule table or directly in the static definitions.

	   typedef struct {
	      char extension[10];
	      char type[SSPEC_MAXNAME];
	      int  (*fptr)(void* server_data); // This is used for server-specific processing e.g. SSI.
	   } MIMETypeMap;

   Note that this structure was historically called "HttpType", and this
   typedef is still available if you #use http.lib.

   A MIMETypeMap table is only required if you are using HTTP or another server
   which uses MIME types.

   Rather than explicitly declaring and initializing the MIME table using
   normal C initializers, it is recommended that new applications use the
   set of macros

		SSPEC_MIMETABLE_START
		SSPEC_MIME(extension, type)
		SSPEC_MIME_FUNC(extension, type, function)
		SSPEC_MIMETABLE_END

   For example, with a typical web server application, you would place the
   following code in your main C program:

      SSPEC_MIMETABLE_START
      SSPEC_MIME(".html", "text/html"),
      SSPEC_MIME_FUNC(".shtml", "text/html", shtml_handler),
      SSPEC_MIME(".jpg", "image/jpeg"),
      SSPEC_MIME(".gif", "image/gif"),
      SSPEC_MIME_FUNC(".cgi", "text/html", my_cgi_handler)
      SSPEC_MIMETABLE_END

   The SSPEC_MIME_FUNC variation allows a C function to be associated with
   that MIME table entry.  This is used for SSI (.shtml) and CGI (Common
   Gateway Interface) facilities in the web server.

   Status Return
   -------------

   A new zserver function, sspec_stat(), returns information about a
   file-type resource, similar to the Unix stat(2) function.  See the
   documentation with sspec_stat() for more details.

	   typedef struct
	   {
	      word     flags;
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_MDTM    0x0001      // Have modification date/time
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_LENGTH  0x0002      // Have current length
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_WRITE   0x0004      // File is writable
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_EXEC    0x0008      // File is "executable"
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_HIDDEN  0x0010      // "Hidden" attribute bit
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_SYSTEM  0x0020      // "System" attribute bit
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_ARCHIVE 0x0040      // "Archive" attribute bit
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_DIR     0x0080      // This is directory name
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_COMPRESSED 0x0100   // File stored in compressed format
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_MAXLENGTH  0x0200   // Have maximum length
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_SEEKABLE   0x0400   // Resource is randomly accessible
	   #define SSPEC_ATTR_EXTENSIBLE 0x0800   // File may be expanded at end

	      long     mdtm;          // Modification date/time (SEC_TIMER format)
	      long     length;        // Current file size
	      long     maxlength;     // Maximum allowable file size
	      ServerPermissions *
	               perm;          // Access (groups and server)
	   } SSpecStat;

   In general, you should look at the flag bits to see if a particular
   field is filled in.  Some of the data is not available for certain
   filesystems, so don't assume it is always available.

   The ServerPermissions struct pointer is always filled in.  This information
   is maintained by zserver, not the filesystem.


   Server Contextual Information
   -----------------------------

   Zserver now requires each server to maintain some context information.
   In particular, zserver now implements the concept of a "current
   working directory".  Zserver itself does not remember the CWD, but it
   does provide functions to support it.  The ServerContext structure
   must be provided by the server to zserver when required.

   Since zserver now supports more powerful access control, the
   ServerContext structure also contains the "current userid".
   It also identifies the server which is calling the zserver function,
   via the "server" field.

	   typedef struct
	   {
	      int      userid;           // Current user ID (-1 if none)
	      word     server;           // Mask bit of this server e.g.
         										// SERVER_HTTP.
	      char *   rootdir;          // "Root directory", or NULL for default
                                    //  root.
	      char     cwd[SSPEC_MAXNAME+1];   // Current working directory.  This
         									// must include the root directory, if any,
                                    // as a prefix.  Null terminated.
	      char *   dfltname;         // Default file name to append if attempt
         									// to open a directory. e.g. this would be
                                    // "index.html" for web server.
	      SSpecFileHandle * dirlist; // File handle for directory listing.
         									// This is used by zserver internally
	                                 // for remembering state during a directory
                                    // list sequence.  Should not be touched by
                                    // server during such a sequence.
	   } ServerContext;


CONTROL MACROS:

	There are several configuration macros that may be set up by the
   application to control the memory usage and behavior of zserver.
   These should be defined before #use zserver.lib, unless otherwise noted.

	   ZSERVER_DEBUG

      	Define to enable Dynamic C single-stepping in the zserver library.

      ZSERVER_VERBOSE

      	Define to enable some printf()'s of common error situations.  For
         debugging only.

	   HTTP_MAXRAMSPEC

      	This macro is deprecated.  Use SSPEC_MAXSPEC instead.

	   SSPEC_MAXSPEC

      	Define to the number of dynamic (RAM) resource table entries to
         allocate.  Each entry takes SSPEC_MAXNAME + 23 bytes of root
         memory (or SSPEC_MAXNAME + 33 if FORM_ERROR_BUF is defined).

         Defaults to 10 entries (approx 530 bytes).  Do not set higher
         than 511.

	   SSPEC_MAXNAME

      	Define the maximum name length of each dynamic or static resource.
         Defaults to 20.  You can minimize memory usage by choosing short
         names for all resources, and reducing the value of this macro.

	   SERVER_PASSWORD_ONLY

			This is set to a bitmask of the server mask bits for each server
         which supports the concept of a "password-only" user i.e. no
         user name.  Defaults to zero, since currently no servers are
         implemented which use this facility.

	   SSPEC_MAXRULES

      	Define the maximum number of dynamically added "rules".  Defaults
         to 10, but you can explicitly define it to zero if all the rule
         table entries are static (see SSPEC_RULETABLE_* macros).  Each
         rule takes up 13 bytes of root storage.

	   SAUTH_MAXNAME

			Define the maximum length of a user name or password.  Defaults
         to 20 characters.

	   SAUTH_MAXUSERS

      	Define the maximum number of unique users.  Defaults to 4.  This
         determines the size of the userid table.  Each table entry takes
         up 2*SAUTH_MAXNAME + 8 bytes of root storage.

      SSPEC_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_WRITE

      	If defined, allow "anonymous" user write access to resources.
         By default, this is denied.  The "anonymous" user is defined
         as a user which is not listed in the userid list (i.e. the
         sauth handle is -1).

	   SSPEC_XMEMVARLEN

			This determines the maximum length of xmem "variables".  Defaults
         to 20.  The size of this only determines the amount of stack space
         used by the sspec_readvariable() function.

	   SSPEC_MAX_FATDEVS

      	Determine the maximum number of independent FAT filesystem "devices".
         Defaults to 1.  Each device takes 8 bytes of root storage (plus
         whatever is required by the filesystem itself).  Each device can
         have up to 4 partitions.  This is only relevant if you use the
         FAT library.

	   SSPEC_MAX_OPEN

      	Determine the maximum number of simultaneously open resources.
         Defaults to 4.  Choose this number carefully, since each entry
         can take up a fairly large amount of root storage, depending
         on the mix of filesystems in use.  For example, with the FAT
         filesystem each open resource needs over 600 bytes.  Unless you
         are anticipating a very busy server, 4 should be enough.

	   SSPEC_DEFAULT_READGROUPS
	   SSPEC_DEFAULT_WRITEGROUPS
	   SSPEC_DEFAULT_SERVERMASK
	   SSPEC_DEFAULT_REALM
	   SSPEC_DEFAULT_METHOD

      	This group of macros establishes global default permissions
         for resources which do not have a rule associated.  For
         readgroups, the default is '0xFFFF' which means "all
         users".  For writegroups, this is '0' meaning "no
         users".  servermask defaults to SERVER_ANY (all servers
         can access).  realm defaults to "" i.e. an empty string,
         or no realm.  method defaults to no authentication method
         required.

	   FORM_ERROR_BUF

      	This macro must be defined to use automatic HTTP server
         forms generation.  Use of this macro slightly increases the
         size of each resource table entry (static or dynamic).


MACROS FOR CONTROL DATA INITIALIZATION:

	Static Rule Table
   -----------------

	   SSPEC_FLASHRULES

			Define this if your application is using static rules.  You
         must define this if you want to use the following macro.  If
         you do this, and you do not need dynamic rules, then you can
         define the macro SSPEC_MAXRULES to zero to recover the
         root memory that would be otherwise wasted.

	   SSPEC_RULETABLE_START
	   SSPEC_RULE(prefix, realm, rg, wg, sm)
	   SSPEC_MM_RULE(prefix, realm, rg, wg, sm, method, mimetype)
	   SSPEC_RULETABLE_END

      	This sequence of macros is used to define static rules.
         See the documentation with the sspec_addrule() function
         for more information.  You must define SSPEC_FLASHRULES
         to use these macros.


	Static MIME Type Table
   ----------------------

		SSPEC_MIMETABLE_START
		SSPEC_MIME(extension, type)
		SSPEC_MIME_FUNC(extension, type, function)
		SSPEC_MIMETABLE_END

      	This sequence sets up the MIME type mapping table.  You
         only need such a table if using a server which requires
         MIME types.  Currently, only the HTTP server needs this.

         Only a static MIME table is supported.  Currently, you
         cannot dynamically add new MIME types to this table,
         however it is possible to allocate new MIMETypeMap
         structures in RAM and assign them to specific resources
         using sspec_addrule() or sspec_setpermissions().  Such
         entries will not be accessed using the default resource
         name extension method.


	Static Resource Table
   ---------------------

		SSPEC_NO_STATIC
	   HTTP_NO_FLASHSPEC

      	Define if there is to be NO static resource table i.e. all resources
         are in the dynamic (RAM) table or in the filesystem(s).  If you
         define this, then there is no point in using the SSPEC_RESOURCE_*
         series of macros below.  Note that both of these are equivalent
         (HTTP_NO_FLASHSPEC is provided for backwards compatibility).

		SSPEC_RESOURCETABLE_START
		SSPEC_RESOURCE_ROOTFILE(name, addr, len)
		SSPEC_RESOURCE_XMEMFILE(name, addr)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_ZMEMFILE(name, addr)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_FSFILE(name, fnum)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_ROOTVAR(name, addr, type, format)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_XMEMVAR(name, addr, type, format)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_FUNCTION(name, addr)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_CGI(name, addr)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_P_ROOTFILE(name, addr, len, realm, rg, wg, sm, meth)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_P_XMEMFILE(name, addr, realm, rg, wg, sm, meth)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_P_ZMEMFILE(name, addr, realm, rg, wg, sm, meth)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_P_FSFILE(name, fnum, realm, rg, wg, sm, meth)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_P_ROOTVAR(name, addr, type, format, realm, rg, wg, sm, meth)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_P_XMEMVAR(name, addr, type, format, realm, rg, wg, sm, meth)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_P_FUNCTION(name, addr, realm, rg, wg, sm, meth)
      SSPEC_RESOURCE_P_CGI(name, addr, realm, rg, wg, sm, meth)
      SSPEC_RESOURCETABLE_END

      	These macros are used to initialize the static resource table (which
         used to be performed by explicitly using C language initialization
         of a table declared as "const HttpSpec http_spec[]".  These macros
         perform the same function, however it is recommended to use them
         instead of static initializers for forward compatibility.

         The macros with _P_ in the name are the same as the others, except
         that they explicitly allow all the server permissions information
         to be initialized as well (see sspec_addrule()) except for the
         MIME type mapping.

         The "name" parameter to all these macros is the resource name.
         This usually starts with a "/" for files, but not for variables.
         The string length should be less than or equal to SSPEC_MAXNAME.

         The other parameters depend on the resource type being created:
				ROOTFILE: addr = root memory address of 1st byte of file,
                      len = length of file (0..32767).
            XMEMFILE: addr = longword (physical address) of the length
                             word of the file.  The length word (4 bytes)
                             is followed by the 1st byte of data.
         	ZMEMFILE: as for XMEMFILE, except the file is compressed and
                      imported using #zimport instead of #ximport.
            FSFILE:   fnum = FS2 file number of file (1..255)
            ROOTVAR:  addr = root memory address of data
                      type = type of data, as documented with
                             sspec_addvariable().
                      format = char * format, as used by printf() e.g.
                             "%d" for a decimal number.
            XMEMVAR:	 as for ROOTVAR except the address is a longword
                      physical address.
            FUNCTION: addr = address of C function.

         Note that a maximum of 511 static resource table entries can
         be defined.


API FUNCTIONS:

   Deprecated Functions
   --------------------

   The following functions are either no longer supported, or are
   replaced with more efficient or more capable functions.

   int sspec_save(void);
   int sspec_setsavedata(char* data, unsigned long len, void* fptr);
   int sspec_restore(void);
		- Not supported.

   int sspec_openfilehandle(SSpecFileHandle *handle, int sspec);
   int sspec_readfilehandle(SSpecFileHandle *handle, char *buffer,
                                 int len);
   int sspec_seekfilehandle(SSpecFileHandle *handle, long new_pos);
   int sspec_closefilehandle(SSpecFileHandle *handle);
   	- Replaced with sspec_open(), sspec_read(), sspec_seek(),
        and sspec_close() respectively.  Note that SSpecFileHandle's
        are now managed internally.

   int sspec_setuser(int sspec, int userid);
   int sspec_adduser(int sspec, int userid);
   int sspec_removeuser(int sspec, int userid);
   	- Replaced with more general sspec_setpermissions() function.

   int sspec_readfile(int sspec, char* buffer, long offset, int len);
		- This may be inefficient, and does not support all filesystems.
        It has the advantage of being "stateless", but the price
        to pay is in great loss of efficiency (especially when
        sequential access is all that is required.)

   int sspec_needsauthentication(int sspec);
   	- This is replaced by sspec_checkpermissions().  This function
        assumes that a non-NULL "realm" string indicates the
        resource needs authentication.

   int sspec_checkaccess(int sspec, int userid);
   	- This is replaced by sspec_checkpermissions().  This function
        only checks read access.

   char* sspec_getusername(int sspec);
   int sspec_getuserid(int sspec, int index);
   	- Because of the change to group-based access control,
        these functions do not work as may be expected.

// This struct contains pointers to functions which are implemented by the
// particular filesystem/device.  We use this to avoid having a ton of switch
// statements (and conditional compilation) in the zserver code.  Most of the
// function pointers are optional.  They should be set to NULL if the operation
// is not implemented or required for the particular filesystem.
// Return value conventions:
// .  If the return value is an 'int', then the function should return 0 for
//    success, or otherwise return the negative of one of the error codes in
//    ERRNO.H.
// .  If the return value is long, the returned value is the desired result
//    of the method.
// Parameter conventions:
// .  See the SSPEC_**_DECL macros below.
// .  The methods are divided into two categories: those which take a
//    path/partition, and those which take a pointer to a SSpecFileHandle.
//    The former act on absolute path names in the given partition (for
//    multi-partition filesystems), and the latter act only on files which have
//    been opened via sspec_open().
// Note: these methods should only be called by the zserver library.  The
// server ("application") does not call them directly, but rather via the
// sspec_* functions.

sspec_fatregister                             <ZSERVER.LIB>

SYNTAX: int sspec_fatregister(int partno, fat_part * pt);

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, server

DESCRIPTION:   This function must be used to register all FAT partitions
               which will be accessible to zserver.lib.  Partitions are
               numbered consecutively from 0, and they correspond to
               mount points /A, /B, /C etc.

               It is assumed that, by the time this function is called,
               the required devices and partitions have been mounted.
               For example, call fat_EnumDevice() followed by as many
               fat_MountPartition() calls as required.  The fat_part
               pointer returned by fat_MountPartition() should be
               passed to this function.  Up to SSPEC_MAX_PARTITIONS
               can be registered.  This number can be changed indirectly
               by defining SSPEC_MAX_FATDEVS before #use zserver.lib.
               This defaults to one device, and the number of partitions
               is set to 4 times this number (hence the default allows
               up to four partitions).

               NOTE: it is NOT necessary to call this function if you
               called sspec_automount(SSPEC_MOUNT_FAT,...) since that
               function does all necessary initializations for a
               single "device".

PARAMETER1:		Partition number to register.  This starts at 0, corres-
               ponding to the '/A' mount point; 1 for '/B' etc.
PARAMETER2:    Pointer to fat_part data structure returned by
               fat_MountPartition etc.  To unregister a partition, pass
               NULL for this parameter.  Note: attempted access to an
               unregistered partition generally results in an error
               code of -ENXIO.

RETURN VALUE:  >=0 	OK
               -ENXIO	error: the specified partno is outside the allowable
                     range of 0..SSPEC_MAX_PARTITIONS-1.

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, server

DESCRIPTION:   This function automatically initializes and 'mounts' the
               specified filesystem(s) for use by zserver.

               You must #use the appropriate filesystem library (e.g.
               FS2.LIB) otherwise the filesystem will not be mountable.

               If using the FAT library, this function will mount all
               devices and partitions using the fat_AutoMount() function.
               Note that zserver.lib assigns 'drive letters' to each
               mounted FAT partition.  Unlike PC operating systems (and
               BIOSes), the drive letters are fixed: mount point '/A'
               always refers to the first partition on the first drive;
               '/D' is always the 4th partition etc.  Basically, this
               means that the drive letters do not move around depending
               on which partitions happen to be mounted at any particular
               time.

               For FS2, all logical extents will be initialized via the
               fs_init() function.


PARAMETER1:		Which filesystem(s) to mount.  This is a bitwise OR of the
               following constants:
                 SSPEC_MOUNT_FS   - FS or FS2 flash filesystem
                 SSPEC_MOUNT_FAT  - FAT filesystem.
               You can also pass SSPEC_MOUNT_ANY to mount all known
               filesystems.
PARAMETER2:		This parameter is used to return FAT partition information.
               If partition info required, pass a valid pointer.
               Otherwise, pass a NULL pointer.
PARAMETER3:		This parameter is currently reserved for returning FS2
               information.  For now, pass as NULL.
PARAMETER4:		Reserved for other filesystems.  For now, pass as NULL.

RETURN VALUE:  0 	OK

DESCRIPTION:   Add a rule to the dynamic resource rule table.  Resource
					rules are used to associate access information with
               resource names matching the specified prefix string.
               Note that the most specific i.e. longest matching string
               is used.

               Normally, the rule table is consulted only for resource
               names which belong in a file system (FS2 or FAT).  You
               can also cause the rule table to be consulted for flash-
               or RAM-table entries if you leave the "realm" field as
               NULL in the entry.  If the realm field is not NULL, then
               the rule table is NOT consulted for that entry.  If the
               realm field was NULL, and there was no applicable entry
               in the rule table, then the resource table permissions
               are used (with NULL realm).

               Note: you should not attempt to use a very large number
               of rule table entries, since the table must be searched
               exhaustively for each initial resource access.  There
               should be no need for a large number of entries provided
               that the resource name hierarchy is organized in a
               reasonably efficient manner.  For example, keep the
               resources for a particular user or realm in one
               directory, and just add an entry for that directory
               instead of an entry for each resource.  This works
               because the full path name is always used for matching,
               and the directory will always be a prefix string of the
               files which reside in that directory.

               As an alternative to this function, you can also statically
               initialize a rule table using the following macros:

                 #define SSPEC_FLASHRULES		// required.
                 #use "zserver.lib"  // this lib

                 SSPEC_RULETABLE_START
                    SSPEC_RULE("prefix", realm, rg, wg, sm)
                   ,SSPEC_RULE("prefix", realm, rg, wg, sm)
                    SSPEC_MM_RULE("prefix", realm, rg, wg, sm, meth, mime)
                   ,SSPEC_MM_RULE("prefix", realm, rg, wg, sm, meth, mime)
                    ...
                 SSPEC_RULETABLE_END

               where the SSPEC_MM_RULE macro parameters are basically
               the same parameters as would be passed to this function.
               These macros define and initialize a constant rule
               table named f_rule_table.  SSPEC_RULE just omits the
               (rarely used) method and mimetype fields.

               If using a static rule table, the dynamically added
               entries will be searched before the static ones.

PARAMETER1:		prefix of resource name.  This must include the initial
					'/' character, since all matching is done using absolute
               path names.  If this prefix string exactly matches an
               existing entry in the table, that entry is replaced.
               Otherwise, a new entry is created (if possible).  This
               string is not copied, only the pointer is stored.  Thus,
               the parm must point to static storage i.e. string
               constant or a global variable.
               Initial characters other than '/' are reserved for
               future use.
PARAMETER2:		If not NULL, is an arbitrary null-terminated string
					which may be used by the server.  For HTTP, this is used
               as the "realm" of the resource.  This string is not
               copied, only the pointer is stored.  Thus, the parm must
               point to static storage.
PARAMETER3:		A word with a bit set for each group which can access
					this resource for reading.  A maximum of 16 different
               user groups can exist.
PARAMETER4:		A word with a bit set for each group which can access
					this resource for writing.  The user must also be given
               permission to write resources in the userid table entry,
               for the appropriate server(s).
PARAMETER5:		The server(s) which are allowed to access this resource.
					Servers have predefined bits.  This parm should be a
               combination of
                 SERVER_HTTP : web server
                 SERVER_FTP : file transfer protocol server
                 SERVER_SMTP : email
                 SERVER_HTTPS : secure web server
                 SERVER_SNMP : SNMP agent
                 SERVER_IDIGI : iDigi server
                 SERVER_USER : user-defined server.
               or could be SERVER_ANY for all servers.
PARAMETER6:		Allowable authentication method(s) to be used when
					accessing this resource.  This is a bitwise combination
               of
                 SERVER_AUTH_BASIC : plaintext userid/password
                 SERVER_AUTH_DIGEST : challenge-response protocol (only
                   useful if USE_HTTP_DIGEST_AUTHENTICATION is defined
                   before inclusion of the HTTP library).
                 SERVER_AUTH_PK: public key (such as SSL/TLS)
            	    This is not yet implemented; reserved for future use.
               If zero, then the resource has no particular authentication
               method requirements.
PARAMETER7:		An appropriate MIME type to use.  If NULL, then the default
               table (called http_types) will be consulted.

RETURN VALUE:  >=0 	OK
               -1		error e.g. out of space in rule table.  In this
                     case, the macro SSPEC_MAXRULES should be increased.

DESCRIPTION: 	Return the MIME type information for a specified resource
               name, in the given server context.

               Note that the available MIME types are set up by defining
               a global variable (or constant) table using the
               definition (for example)

                 const MIMETypeMap http_types[] =
                 {
	               { ".html", "text/html", NULL},
	               { ".gif", "image/gif", NULL}
             	  };

               The name 'http_types' is required for backward compatibility
               even though servers other than HTTP can make use of MIME
               types.

               When searching for the appropriate type, the rule table
               is consulted first.  Only if this results in a NULL mime
               type pointer is the http_types table consulted.

               See sspec_open() for more detailed description of the
               parameters.

PARAMETER1: 	Name of the resource.
PARAMETER2: 	Current server context.

RETURN VALUE:  Pointer to the appropriate table entry.  MIMETypeMap is
               defined as
	               typedef struct {
	                  char extension[10];	// File extension or suffix.
	                  char type[SSPEC_MAXNAME]; // MIME type e.g. "text/html"
	                  int  (*fptr)();   // This is used for server-specific
                                       // processing e.g. SSI.
	               } MIMETypeMap;
               A valid pointer is always returned.  If the appropriate
               table entry cannot be located by the resource's extension
               (or using a rule (see sspec_addrule)) then the first
               table entry is returned.

               NOTE: do not attempt to alias a sspec handle which was
               returned by sspec_open(), because the handle may be
               dynamically allocated.  In such a case, the alias will

SYNTAX: int sspec_readfile(int sspec, char* buffer, long offset, int len);

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, server

DESCRIPTION: 	Read a file represented by the sspec index into a given
					buffer, starting at a given offset, and only copying a
					given length. For xmem files, this function automatically
					skips the first 4 bytes.  Hence, an offset of 0 marks the
					beginning of the file contents, not the file length.

               This function is intended for file types which do not
               require explicit 'open' or 'close' calls i.e. root or
               xmem files.  It can also be called for FS2 files, but this
               is not recommended since each call requires the file to
               be opened, seeked, read then closed.  Instead, use the
               sspec_readfilehandle() call which is more efficient, or
               use sspec_open(), sspec_read() and sspec_close() calls
               which are the most efficient.

               This function will NOT work for compressed xmem files
               or DOS FAT files.

PARAMETER1: 	spec index
PARAMETER2:		buffer in which to put the file contents
PARAMETER3:		offset in the file at which copying should begin
PARAMETER4:		number of bytes to copy

RETURN VALUE:  >= 0	number of bytes copied

SYNTAX: int sspec_open(char far * name, const ServerContext * context,
                       word mode, word alloc);

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, server

DESCRIPTION:	Open a resource by name.  The name may refer
               to a flash- or ram-spec entry, or may be the name of a
               file in a filesystem.

               The resource namespace is specified as a directory
               hierarchy, similar to a Unix-like filesystem.  The root
               directory, '/', is the base for all named resources.

               If "fs2.lib" is included, then files stored in the FS2
               filesystem are accessible under a "mount point" called
               "/fs2".  FS2 files do not have native names.  Instead,
               each file is numbered from 1 to 255.  Zserver assigns
               names to FS2 files by appending the file number (in
               decimal) to the string "file".  For example, FS2 file
               number 99 has a complete resource name of "/fs2/file99".

               If "fatxx.lib" is included, then all DOS FAT files are
               mounted under a drive letter.  The first partition of the
               first DOS FAT filesystem is called "/A", the second
               partition (if any) is called "/B" etc.  For example,
               if the FAT filesystem has a file called
               "/system/admin.htm" then the complete resource name
               will be "/A/system/admin.htm".  [Note: forward
               slashes are required.  Do not use backslashes as is
               customary with DOS filesystems.]

               If the resource name does not begin with "/fs2" or
               "/A" etc., then the resource is located in the static
               resource table ("flashspec" i.e. the http_flashspec
               global table) or in the dynamic (RAM) table.

               The return value from this function must be passed to
               other functions, such as sspec_read(), in order to
               access the resource.  A few functions do not work with
               resources opened with this function.  These cases are
               documented with the function.

               NOTE!
               When the application has finished acessing the resource,
               it must be explicitly closed using sspec_close().  This
               must be done, since there is a limited amount of storage
               for maintaining the necessary file handles.

PARAMETER1:		Resource name, as a null terminated string.  This name
					is assumed to be relative to context->cwd if it does not
               begin with a '/' character.  Otherwise, the name is
               assumed to be relative to context->rootdir.  Note that the
               name string can contain "." and ".." directory components.
               These will be interpreted as 'same directory' and 'one
               level up' as is customary.  If '..' components are
               included, the resulting name cannot be above or outside
               the root directory specified in context->rootdir.
PARAMETER2:		Additional context information.  The ServerContext struct
					should be set up by the caller.  It contains the
               following fields:

                 typedef struct {
                 		int	userid;	// User ID of the current user, or
                     					// -1 if not applicable.
                     word	server;	// Server identifier (e.g. SERVER_HTTP)
                     char * rootdir;// Root directory.  This is usually
                     		 			// "/" if the whole namespace is to
                                    // be accessible.  Otherwise, it may
                                    // be e.g. "/A" to restrict access
                                    // to just the first DOS FAT partition.
                                    // -- first and last char must be '/'!
                     char cwd[];		// Current working directory.  This
                     					// would normally include rootdir as
                                    // a prefix.  First and last char
                                    // must be '/'.
                     char * dfltname;// A file name to be used as a
                     					// resource name suffix in the case
                                    // that the first parameter refers
                                    // to a directory name.
                 } ServerContext;
PARAMETER3:		Resource opening mode.  Bitwise OR of the following
					macros:
                 O_READ: open for reading
                 O_WRITE: open for writing (implies reading as well)
                 O_CREAT: with O_WRITE, if file does not exist then
                   create it with zero length and allocation.
                 O_TRUNC: with O_WRITE, if file already exists,
                   truncate it to zero length.
                 O_APPEND: with O_WRITE, if file already exists,
                   position at end of file so as to append new data.
                   You can later seek to the existing portion of the
                   file.
PARAMETER4:		Initial allocation mode (only if creating new resource).
               The value specifies the number of 1k blocks to pre-
               allocate.  This is ignored if the underlying file
               system does not support pre-allocation.  Note that
               passing a value which is too big will needlessly waste
               space in the filesystem.  Passing the correct value
               (or at least a good guess) can improve following
               write performance.

RETURN VALUE:   >=0		success.  The returned value should be passed to
						other function which require a general handle, such
                  as sspec_read(), sspec_seek(), sspec_write(),
                  sspec_tell(), and sspec_close().
       			note: the following return values are negatives of the
                  values defined in "errno.h".
               -ENOENT		The resource was not found when it was
                  expected to exist.
               -EACCES     The context->userid field was not -1, and
                  the specified user is not allowed to access the
                  resource using the specified mode.
               -EINVAL     The resource name was malformed (e.g. too long),
                  or context was NULL, or the resource was not a file type,
                  or O_CREAT,O_TRUNC or O_APPEND were specified without
                  O_WRITE.

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, server

DESCRIPTION:	Read the next byte(s) from the given resource.

PARAMETER1:		Open file handle.  This must be a handle that was returned
					by sspec_open().
PARAMETER2:		Buffer into which data is copied.
PARAMETER3:		Length of the above buffer.  If len is zero, then the
               return value will be the minimum number of characters
               that could be read at the current position, which is
               usually at least 1 except at EOF (0).  Thus, this function
               can also be used to test for EOF e.g.
                 if (sspec_read(sspec, NULL, 0) == 0)
                 		... is at EOF ...

RETURN VALUE:  0: No data is currently available.  If the len parameter
                  was zero, then a return value of 0 definitely means
                  end-of-file has been reached.  If len > 0, there may
                  be data available in the future e.g. because the
                  underlying filesystem is socket-based and this host
                  has read all available data, but the socket is still
                  open to receive more data.
               1..len: the specified number of characters has been copied
                  to the supplied buffer, and the current file position
                  has been advanced by that many bytes.  Possibly less
                  than len bytes may be read, in which case the server
                  should test for EOF.
               >len: no data was copied, because the underlying filesystem
                  is unable to return a partial record and maintain its
                  current position.  The return value is the minimum
                  sized buffer which should be passed on the next call.
                  Note: this sort of return is not currently implemented
                  by any of the file systems, however servers should be
                  coded to handle this case for future anticipated systems
                  which have record-level access rather than byte-level.

DESCRIPTION:	Read the next byte(s) from the given resource, until
               specified delimiter is read and transferred to buffer.
               If EOF is encountered before reading a delimiter char,
               then the buffer may not be terminated with the delimiter
               char.  Similarly if the delimiter was not found before
               the given buffer was full.  The buffer is *not* null
               terminated.

PARAMETER1:		Open file handle.  This must be a handle that was returned
					by sspec_open().
PARAMETER2:		Buffer into which data is copied.
PARAMETER3:		Length of the above buffer.
PARAMETER4:		Delimiter character.

RETURN VALUE:  0: No data is currently available.
               1..len: the specified number of characters has been copied
                  to the supplied buffer, and the current file position
                  has been advanced by that many bytes.  Possibly less
                  than len bytes may be read, in which case the server
                  should test for EOF.
               >len: no data was copied, because the underlying filesystem
                  is unable to return a partial record and maintain its
                  current position.  The return value is the minimum
                  sized buffer which should be passed on the next call.
                  Note: this sort of return is not currently implemented
                  by any of the file systems, however servers should be
                  coded to handle this case for future anticipated systems

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, server

DESCRIPTION:	Change the current working directory in the ServerContext
               structure.  This function may be used by servers which
               support the concept of a 'current directory', such as FTP
               (but not HTTP).  Standard Unix-like path names are used,
               including support for '.' and '..' directory components.

               The resulting directory name is not allowed to be closer
               to the root directory than context->rootdir.  If there
               is any specification error, then the current directory
               is not changed.

               The resulting absolute directory name cannot be longer
               than SSPEC_MAXNAME, including a leading and trailing
               '/' character.

               If the 3rd parameter is true:

               If the new directory seems valid, it is checked to see
               if there is such a directory.  Only if the directory
               exists is the change made.

PARAMETER1:		New directory path string, as a null-terminated string.
					If this starts with '/', it is merely appended to the
               context->rootdir string.  Otherwise, it is appended to
               the current directory (in context->cwd).  Directory
               components are separated by '/' characters.  A trailing
               slash is optional.  A directory component '.' means
               'no change to this level', and a component of '..' means
               'up one level' (towards the root).
PARAMETER2:		Server context structure.  Two fields in this are of
					interest: rootdir points to a virtual root directory
               for this server.  E.g., if the FTP server was only
               allowed to access files under the /A/ directory, then
               rootdir would point to a string "/A/".  Then, if the
               user entered a directory name of "/ftpfiles/" then the
               full directory would be "/A/ftpfiles/".
               The other field, which is updated by this function, is
               called cwd.  This is an array of characters of length
               SSPEC_MAXNAME.  It contains the absolute path of the
               current directory, with leading and trailing slash,
               including the rootdir part (if any).
PARAMETER3:		If TRUE, check the resulting directory name to see if
               it exists.  Otherwise, no check is made.

RETURN VALUE:  0: OK.
               Any other negative values indicate an error:
               	-E2BIG   resulting directory name too long
                  -EACCES  attempt to change above root directory
                  -ENOENT  3rd parameter was TRUE, and the directory
                           did not exist.

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, server

DESCRIPTION:	Print the current working directory in the ServerContext
               structure, to the specified buffer.  The context->cwd
               field contains the CWD.  This function removes the
               root directory component (context->rootdir) and copies
               the result.  This makes rootdir 'invisible' to the
               end user.

               The leading slash is included, but the trailing slash is
               omitted from the result (unless the result is just '/').

               Example:

                 context->rootdir points to "/A/"
                 context->cwd[] contains "/A/ftpfiles/"

                 result will be "/ftpfiles"

PARAMETER1:		Server context structure.  Two fields in this are of
					interest: rootdir points to a virtual root directory
               for this server, and cwd is a char array containing the
               CWD.
PARAMETER2:		Points to buffer which is filled with resulting string.
               This buffer is assumed to be dimensioned at least
               SSPEC_MAXNAME chars long, and it will be null terminated
               on return.

RETURN VALUE:  The buf parameter is returned.

KEYWORDS:		tcpip, server

DESCRIPTION:	Return formatted directory listing line.  To use this
               function, call it with item=0 the first time, then keep
               calling it with item = <previous return value> until
               it returns negative.  This allows you to iterate through all
               entries in a directory.

               The ServerContext struct contains the current user ID,
               server, and the name of the directory to list.

               Note: For a given directory, you should call this function
               with item=0, followed by more calls until it returns -1.
               If you want to terminate the directory listing without
               iterating through every entry, pass the SSPEC_LIST_END
               option flag (see below).  This allows zserver to release
               any temporary resources acquired for the purpose of
               iterating through the directory.  This is especially
               important for FAT filesystem listings.  After this function
               returns negative, you must start the next directory listing
               from the top i.e. item=0.

               If you do not complete the listing, then your application
               may not be able to perform further listings owing to
               internal resource leakage -- this is similar to the need
               to close files which are opened.  See the 2nd example below.

               You should pass the same ServerContext struct for the
               entire directory list sequence, since zserver keeps track
               of state information in this struct.

EXAMPLE:			To iterate through all resources under "/A/":

						ServerContext ctx;
                  int item;
                  char buf[80];
                  word opts;
                  word n;

                  ctx.rootdir = "/";
                  ctx.server = SERVER_FTP;
                  ctx.userid = sauth_getuserid("foo", SERVER_FTP);
						sspec_cd("/A", &ctx);
						for (item = 0; item >= 0; ) {
							item = sspec_dirlist(item, buf, sizeof(buf),
                                          &ctx, SSPEC_LIST_LONG);
                     if (item >= 0)
                     	printf(buf);
                  }
                  // finished now, can re-use ctx.

               To iterate through the first 5 resources only:

               	opts = SSPEC_LIST_LONG;
						for (item = 0, n = 0; item >= 0; ++n) {
                     if (n >= 4)
                     	opts |= SSPEC_LIST_END;
							item = sspec_dirlist(item, buf, sizeof(buf),
                                          &ctx, opts);
                     if (item >= 0)
                     	printf(buf);
                  }


PARAMETER1:		Directory entry to list.  If zero, this always returns the
               first entry in the directory.  Thereafter, you should pass
               the return value from the previous call to this function
               to get the next item(s).  NOTE: the return value does not
               necessarily count up 1, 2, 3 etc.  Apart from 0, the only
               values you should pass in this parameter are previous
               return values, otherwise the results will be undefined.
PARAMETER2:		Points to buffer which is filled with resulting string.
					The string will be terminated with \r\n (CRLF) then a null.
PARAMETER3:		Length of the above buffer.  If it is not long enough, then
					the line will be truncated (however it will still have the
               terminating CRLF + null).  The minimum reasonable value
               is about 15 for format 0, and 80 for format 1.
PARAMETER4:		Server context.  This struct should have the following
					fields initialized:
                 userid: current user who is doing the listing, or -1
                         if no specific user.
                 server: mask bit of the server who is performing the
                         listing.
                 cwd[]:  set to the directory to list.  The sspec_cd()
                         function can be used to set this field
                         correctly.
               This struct must be the same instance for all calls in a
               single directory listing sequence.
PARAMETER5:		Listing options.  This is a bit field which should have
					a combination of the following flags:
                 SSPEC_LIST_LONG		Long format listing (else just names)
                 SSPEC_LIST_BIN		Binary format listing
                 SSPEC_LIST_END     Close the current directory listing.
               For the long format, the template is
                 <permissions> 1 <user> <group> <length> <date> <name>
               Where
               . permissions is a string of 10 characters in 3 sets
                 of 3, plus one.  Each set of 3 indicates read, write
                 or execute permissions for the user, group, and 'world'
                 respectively.  The 1st char is 'd' if the entry is a
                 directory, or '-' otherwise.  Since zserver does not
                 really support file owners or groups, or execute
                 permissions, the 3 sets will be either 'rw-' or 'r--'
                 or sometimes '-w-'.  The user bits are set according
                 to the current user's access.  The group bits are set
                 if any _other_ user has access, and the 'world' bits
                 are set if any other _server_ has access.
               . '1' is a constant for Unix compatibility.
               . user is the username who 'owns' the file.  Since zserver
                 does not have the concept of resource ownership, this is
                 set to the user ID of the context->userid field.  If
                 context->userid is -1, this is set to "anon".
               . group is the resource 'group name'.  zserver does not
                 support this Unix concept either, so this field is set
                 to the realm of the resource (if it has one) otherwise
                 it is set to "anon".
               . length is set to the current length of the file, or
                 0 if not known.
               . date is set to the modification date of the resource in
                 Mon dd yyyy format.
					. name is the name of the resource in this directory.
              Example:
                dr--r--r--  1  foo   admin    0   Jan 1  1980  ftpfiles
                -rw-rw-rw-  1  foo   admin  1250  Mar 16 2003  index.htm
					For the SSPEC_LIST_BIN format, the 'line' parameter points
               to a buffer of type sspec_ls_t, which will be populated
               with available data:
               typedef struct {
               	char	path[SSPEC_MAXNAME*2+1];
                  int	isdir;			// Non-zero for directory
						long	length;			// File length (0 for dir)
                  long	mod_date;		// Seconds since 1980
               } sspec_ls_t;

RETURN VALUE:  -EEOF: there were no (more) entries in this directory.
					Any other negative value: parameter or I/O error.
					Otherwise (non-negative): the return value should be passed
               back to this function as the 'item' parameter value, to
               retrieve the next entry.

               Except for sspec, all parameters are pointers to
               variables which will be set to the appropriate return value.
               If the parameter is NULL, then that information is not
               retrieved.

               The data at **realm and **mimetype should not
               be altered by the caller.  The data is read-only.

PARAMETER1: 	spec index
PARAMETER2:		pointer to pointer to realm string
PARAMETER3:		pointer to mask of user groups who have read access
PARAMETER4:		pointer to mask of user groups who have write access
PARAMETER5:		pointer to servers which can access this resource.
PARAMETER6:		pointer to required authentication method.
PARAMETER7:		pointer to pointer to MIME table entry.


RETURN VALUE:   0		success
               <0		failure e.g. bad sspec handle
