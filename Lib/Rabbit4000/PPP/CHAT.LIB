chat_init                          <CHAT.LIB>

SYNTAX: int chat_init(ChatState * chs, const char * script, ...)

KEYWORDS:		chat

DESCRIPTION: 	Initialize the chat state structure, to prepare it for
               calls to the chat_tick() function.  The chat script,
               passed in 'script', has the following syntax.  Note
               that []... means the enclosed syntax may be given
               zero or more times.

               All the chat_* functions are thread-safe since no static
               data areas are used; however the caller should obviously
               not use static areas for ChatState structure or data
               buffers.  The script and substitution strings may be
               shared, since they are not altered by any chat function.

   Script Syntax:

     [ send expect ]...

     where 'send' is a token to send, and 'expect' is a token to expect
     in return, before the next send/expect pair is executed.  Either
     'send' or 'expect' may be omitted; use empty single quotes as a
     place-holder.

     If an expect token starts with an '&' character, this has special
     meaning: the '&' is stripped off the expect token, and no timeout
     is applied.  This is useful for 'auto answer' scripts where there
     is an indefinite wait time.

     If a send token is prefixed with '#' then the CRLF which is
     normally appended to the token, when sent, is suppressed.  To
     send just a CRLF, specify '#\r\n' as the send token.

     If an expect token is prefixed with '#' (after the '&', if any)
     then the comparison is performed in a case-insensitive manner,
     otherwise the expect token must be matched exactly.  No CRLF is
     expected, unless you explicitly specify it e.g. 'login:\r\n'.

     Either a send or expect token may be prefixed with '@' (after the
     '&' or '#', if any).  This sets a pause timer (default 1.5 seconds)
     which has to time out before the send token is sent, or before
     incoming data are examined for matching the expect token.  Incoming
     data are discarded during the pause interval, so this feature
     should be used with caution when prefixing an expect token, since
     the expected data may be discarded during the pause!

     The sequence '%n' inside a send or expect token indicates that
     one of the strings passed to this function is to be substituted
     for the %n at that point.  The substitution is only performed if
     a non-null parameter was provided.  Otherwise, the %n is included
     literally.

     The token sequence is separated by white space.  If it is desired
     to include whitespace in a token, then the token should be wrapped
     in single quote characters.

     A backslash (\) character in a token denotes an 'escape sequence'
     for inserting special characters, as follows:

     \nnn    From 1 to 3 octal digits (0-7).  This sequence represents
             the octal value of a character e.g. \377 represents the
             decimal character number 255; \1 represents control-A.
             If fewer than 3 octal digits are intended, then the next
             character must not be an octal digit.

     \r\n    represents carriage return followed by newline.  Other
             special characters modelled after C syntax:
             \r CR; \n NL; \b BS; \t TAB; \f FF.

     Any other character following the backslash stands for itself
     e.g. \\ specifies a single backslash, \' stands for a single
     quote.  An escape backslash at the end of a token is a syntax
     error.

     Example:

       chat_init(&chs, // State structure
         "ATDT5551234 #login: @%0 word: @%1 PPP",  // Script
         "myUserid",	  // %0 substitution
         "myPassword", // %1 substitution
         NULL          // End of substitutions
         );

     send dialout command, wait for 'login:', 'LOGIN:' etc., send
     user ID, wait for 'word:', send password, wait for 'PPP' then
     finish.  The leading '@' characters indicate that there is a
     1.5 second pause before sending the userid/password strings.


   String sizes:

     Send strings may be of practically any length, however the 'out'
     buffer passed to chat_tick() must be large enough to hold the
     entire send string at any point.  CHAT_MAXSENDLEN is a macro
     which specifies the maximum number of characters which will be
     put in this buffer.  The default is 128.  Any further data
     are quietly discarded.  If you dimension out[] to this size,
     then no memory overwrites will occur.

     Expect strings are limited in size to CHAT_MAXLEN characters
     (default 30, but may be overridden).  This size is counted after
     performing any escape sequences and string substitutions.  You
     must be careful not to exceed this limit, especially when using
     substitutions; since there is no indication of exceeding this
     limit: any extra data are quietly discarded and only the first
     CHAT_MAXLEN characters will be matched.

   Timeouts:

     The initial overall script timeout is set to 60 seconds.  You can
     change this after calling this function, by calling chat_timeout().
     The timer starts running when chat_init() is called, thus you
     should not call chat_init() until ready to perform the chat
     script.  chat_timeout() also resets the timer.

     The pause timer (@ prefix) is also set using chat_timeout(), and
     defaults to 1.5 seconds.  During the pause interval, any incoming
     data is discarded.

   Error handling:

     If the script has syntax errors, they may not be discovered until
     chat_tick() is called.  Current syntax errors are unbalanced quotes
     and trailing unescaped backslash.

PARAMETER1: 	Pointer to ChatState structure, which must be allocated by
               the caller, but may be left uninitialized.  The structure
               will be initialized by his function, and must be passed
               without changes to other chat_*() functions.
PARAMETER2: 	Chat script to parse, as a null-terminated string.
               After this function is called, the chat script will still
               be required, and should not be moved or altered while
               the returned *chs structure is in use.
PARAMETER3:    Substitution strings for '%' construct.  The list is
               terminated by a NULL pointer.  If provided, these
               parameters should be char pointers.  As many non-NULL
               parameters should be supplied as the highest digit
               following any '%' substitution, +1.  The first parameter
               corresponds to %0, the next to %1 etc. up to %9.
               The strings pointed to by these pointers should not be
               altered until the script is complete.  Each string must
               be null terminated.  Each string may be of arbitrary
               length, however if the substitution is used for an
               'expect' string, then you must be careful that the total
               expect string length does not exceed CHAT_MAXLEN; if used
               for a 'send' string, then the total length should not
               exceed CHAT_MAXSENDLEN.  See above note on string sizes.

RETURN VALUE:  CHAT_AGAIN (0): OK, ready to continue with chat_tick().
               CHAT_ERROR (-2): Syntax error in script
               CHAT_OK (2): Script was empty i.e. nothing to expect or
                  send.

KEYWORDS:		chat

DESCRIPTION: 	This function should be called regularly to drive the
               chat script state machine.  This function should be
               called even when there is no new incoming data, since
               it needs to check timeouts and possibly generate data.

PARAMETER1: 	Pointer to ChatState structure, which must have been
               initialized using the chat_init() function.
PARAMETER2: 	Pointer to address of next set of input
               characters to process.  On return, *in is updated to
               point to the first character that was _not_ processed
               in the stream.  If all characters were processed,
               *in will point past the end of the data.  This will
               always be the case for return codes 0 and 1.  Other
               return codes may leave some unprocessed characters,
               which may be passed to the rest of the application.
PARAMETER3: 	Pointer to length of the above input data.  It is OK to
               pass zero for this value if there is
               no new incoming data.  On return, *inlen is updated to
               indicate the number of characters that were _not_
               processed from in[].
PARAMETER4:    A buffer into which this function can place some data
               to send.  This buffer should be large enough to contain
               the longest send string (after substitutions, if any).
               A maximum of CHAT_MAXSENDLEN bytes will be written to
               this buffer (default 128).  Any further data is
               quietly discarded.

               data in placed.  This value is set only if CHAT_SEND
               is returned.

RETURN VALUE:  CHAT_AGAIN (0): OK, script is not yet finished.
               CHAT_SEND (1): *outlen was set to non-zero i.e. there
                  is some data in out[] which should be sent to the
                  device.  This does not necessarily mean the script
                  has completed.
               CHAT_OK (2): script completed execution, successfully.
               CHAT_ERROR (-2): syntax error
               CHAT_TIMEOUT (-1): script timed out.

chat_timeout                          <CHAT.LIB>

SYNTAX: void chat_timeout(ChatState * chs, long overall, long pause)

KEYWORDS:		chat

DESCRIPTION: 	This function sets chat script timeout parameters.

PARAMETER1: 	Pointer to ChatState structure, which must have been
               initialized using the chat_init() function.  A non-
               positive value leaves the current overall timeout
               unchanged.
PARAMETER2: 	Overall script timeout, in milliseconds.  This timeout
               acts from the point at which this function is called.
               A non-positive value leaves the pause timeout unchanged.
PARAMETER3: 	Pause timeout, in milliseconds.  This timeout only acts
               when the next send or expect token prefixed with '@'
               is encountered.
