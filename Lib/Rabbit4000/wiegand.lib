SYNTAX:		   int wiegand_init(int which, int port_0, int bit_0,
                      int port_1, int bit_1, int num_bits)

DESCRIPTION:   Initialize the Wiegand format card reader interface.

					For Rabbit 4000 and later based boards, external interrupt
               pins may be used in pairs (PE0+4 for which==0, or PE1+5 for
               which==1).  This is recommended if the input capture peripherals
               are needed by other functions.

               If 'which' is 2 or 3, this function sets up the input capture
               peripheral.  The port pins must be set up by the caller to be
               inputs for normal operation.  If the port pins are actually
               outputs, then you can simulate a Wiegand card reader by having
               some other part of your program pulse the pins low (i.e.
               simulating a reader).

               The Wiegand standard allows for low-going TTL pulses with
               pulse width between 20 and 100us.  Pulses are separated
               by between 200us and 20,000us (20ms).

               This implementation allows for an even wider range of
               parameters.  Data is clocked on the falling edge of
               either input.  Two edges (same or different line) should
               not occur less than about 20us apart, otherwise the
               interrupt may not get serviced in time to distinguish
               the bits.  The pulse width should be greater than
               about 0.5us to be captured reliably.

               If electrical noise is a potential problem, then you
               should apply RC filtering to the inputs such that
               the time constant is about half of the low-going
               pulse width.

               It is assumed that pulses come in no slower than every
               3ms.  This is slower than the allowable timing of 20ms
               however most card readers use a 1- or 2-ms interval
               between bits.  If you are connecting a slower card
               reader, you can #define WIEGAND_BIT_INTERVAL to be
               other than the default value of 3.  This macro should
               be defined to be a bit slower than the actual expected
               rate.  E.g. if your reader outputs a new bit every 5ms,
               then #define WIEGAND_BIT_INTERVAL 6 in your main
               application before #use wiegand.lib.

               Note that if you are using CARD_READER.LIB, it also uses
               the input capture peripheral which is required by this
               library (if which=2 or 3).  Since there is only 1 input
               capture interrupt vector, you cannot use both this library
               and the CARD_READER library.

               If you are using only the external interrupts (which =0 or
               1), then this library fully interoperates with
               CARD_READER.LIB.  Thus you can have up to two Wiegand
               readers and one mag stripe reader with a Rabbit board.

PARAMETER1:    0 : use PE0 and PE4 pins (external interrupt 0)
               1 : use PE1 and PE5 pins (external interrupt 1)
                      - PE0/1 are used for the zero bit line,
                      - PE4/5 are used for the one bit line.
               2 : use input capture 0.
               3 : use input capture 1.

               Note that the A8 timer is not altered by this library
               since time stamping is not required.  Thus you are free
               to use the other input capture if you only have one
               Wiegand reader installed on an input capture basis.
PARAMETER2:    Parallel port to which the 'zero bit' line is connected.
               Must be one of PCDR, PDDR, PEDR This parameter is only used
               if 'which' is 2 or 3.
PARAMETER3:    Parallel port bit number to which the 'zero bit' line is
               connected.  Must be one of 1, 3, 5 or 7.  This parameter
               is only used if 'which' is 2 or 3.
PARAMETER4:    Parallel port to which the 'one bit' line is connected.
               Must be one of PCDR, PDDR, PEDR. This parameter is only used
               if 'which' is 2 or 3.
PARAMETER5:    Parallel port bit number to which the 'one bit' line is
               connected.  Must be one of 1, 3, 5 or 7.  This parameter
               is only used if 'which' is 2 or 3.
PARAMETER6:    Number of bits (including parity bits) in the format.
               The most common standard is 26, however this library
               supports any number of bits between 4 and 64 inclusive.

RETURN VALUE:	0 - OK
					-1 - 'which' is invalid should be 0-3.
               -2 - zero bit invalid
               -3 - one bit invalid
               -4 - invalid number of bits.

wiegand_ready                  <WIEGAND.LIB>

SYNTAX:        int wiegand_ready(void)

DESCRIPTION:   Test if a card has been presented to any Wiegand reader.
               The test will return 'true' even if an invalid parity
               has been received, since the parity is not checked until
               wiegand_result() is called.

               Only readers which have been successfully initialized by
               wiegand_init() are tested for ready status.

	            This should be called at least once per second, in order
               to cancel any partial result which is taking too long.
               Preferred to call every N ms, where N is about 4ms times the
               number of bits (e.g. every 100ms for 26-bit format).

               Note that rather than calling this function, you can also
               just call wiegand_result() for a specific reader and check
               for a return code other than WIEGAND_NOT_READY.

RETURN VALUE:	0 - no reader is ready
					non-zero - one or more readers are ready.  Call
                 wiegand_result() to retrieve the result for each non-zero
                 bit in the return value.  Note that no new reading can
                 be obtained until wiegand_result() has been called for
                 a particular reader.
                 Note that this non-zero result is a bitmask of the
                 readers which are ready.  Bit 0 for reader 0, bit 1
                 for reader 1 etc.

SYNTAX:        int wiegand_result(int which,
                    unsigned long * raw_result, unsigned long * result)

DESCRIPTION:   After wiegand_ready() indicates that a reader is ready,
               call this function to retrieve and validate the most recent
               data from the reader.

               You must call this function to reset the reader so it
               is ready for the next card.

               The result values are split into half of the total
               number of bits.  raw_result includes the parity bits,
               and result has the parity bits stripped out.  For
               example, with 26 bit Wiegand format, raw_result[0]
               will contain the least significant 13 bits, with
               the very LSB (bit 0) containing an odd parity.
               raw_result[1] will contain the 13 MSBs, with the
               very MSB (bit 12) containing an even parity for the
               MSBs.  result[0] will contain the 12 LSBs, not
               including parity, and result[1] will contain the
               12 MSBs, not including parity.

               Note: one standard for 26 bit format divides the
               total 24 bit result (not including parity) into
               an 8-bit 'facility' field and a 16-bit 'ID number'.
               This division must be performed by the caller, by
               shifting and combining the two result longwords.
               E.g.

                 auto unsigned long R[2];
                 auto unsigned short fac, id;

                 if (wiegand_result(0, NULL, R) == WIEGAND_OK) {
                   fac = (unsigned short)(R[1] >> 4);
                   id = (unsigned short)(R[0] |
                                        (R[1] & 0x0F) << 12);
                 }


PARAMETER1:    Which reader to access, as specified by the wiegand_init()
               call.
PARAMETER2:		A pointer to two unsigned long values, or NULL.  If not
               NULL, then the first element is set to the least
               significant half of the raw data received, and the
               second element is set to the most significant half.
PARAMETER2:		A pointer to two unsigned long values, or NULL.  If not
               NULL, then the two elements are set as for raw_result,
               except that the parity bits are stripped out.

RETURN VALUE:	WIEGAND_OK (0) - valid card data retrieved
					WIEGAND_NOT_READY (1) - no data is ready.
               WIEGAND_PARITY_ERROR (2) - data was retrieved, but there
                 was a parity error.  raw_result contains the raw data
                 including the parity bits which were in error.
               WIEGAND_INVALID (3) - the reader number is not valid or
                 has not been successfully initialized.
