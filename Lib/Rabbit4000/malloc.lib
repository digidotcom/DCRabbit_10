  This version of malloc.c was adapted for ptmalloc3 by Wolfram Gloger
  <wg@malloc.de>.  Therefore, some of the comments below do not apply
  for this modified version.  However, it is the intention to keep
  differences to Doug Lea's original version minimal, hence the
  comments were mostly left unchanged.


  RABBIT NOTE:

     The following description pertains to the original implementation.
     For the Rabbit 4000, the malloc library uses far pointers exclusively,
     since the original code assumes a flat address space, with at least
     32-bit pointers.

     Rather than using the Unix 'sbrk' function to obtain blocks of memory
     from the 'system', the Rabbit has an equivalent function called xalloc().
     xalloc() cannot return memory to the system, which is one of the
     reasons that this library is provided.

     IMPORTANT: you should understand that malloc/free is subject to
     fragmentation of memory, which can be a major concern to embedded
     applications, since long-running programs may eventually fail to
     allocate memory even if the amount of free memory (reported by
     malloc_stats()) seems to be sufficient.  It is recommended that
     applications avoid using malloc/free in a "random" pattern if at
     all possible.  Fragmentation can be avoided if memory is allocated in
     a "first allocated/last freed" order.  Also it is preferable not to
     have too many different allocation sizes.  If these rules cannot be
     followed, the application should be tested extensively to determine that
     allocations can always succeed.

     Rabbit requires using memory spaces, and only memory spaces.
     In other words, the ONLY_MSPACES macro (and relevant code) has been
	  removed from the original code.

	  Because memory spaces are required, the "default" memory space functions
	  (dlmalloc, dlfree etc.) have been removed.

     The "application" malloc(), free() etc. functions are implemented to
     use storage from the application memory space.  All Rabbit libraries
     default to use of "system" memory space, via the functions _sys_malloc()
     etc.

     In order to support the separate system and application memory spaces,
     the global variables
     	mspace _sys_mem_space;
     	mspace _app_mem_space;
     	mspace _root_mem_space;
     are defined.  These are initialized to null, however when any
     allocation function is called (e.g. realloc, _sys_calloc etc.) then
     the memory spaces are initialized via calls to xalloc().

     The size of the xalloc'd regions for system and application space are
     computed as follows:

  			#define _SYS_MALLOC_BLOCKS  s
  			#define _APP_MALLOC_BLOCKS  a

  	  where s and a are numbers which determine the number of 4k blocks of
  	  xmem which will be allocated for each space:

  	      s > 0 and a > 0  - fixed size allocations
  	      s ==0 and a > 0  - application space is fixed, system takes all
  	                         remaining xmem
         s > 0 and a ==0  - system space is fixed, application takes all
                            remaining xmem
         s ==0 and a ==0  - whichever of system and application space is used
                            first gets all remaining xmem.  This is useful
                            if you know the system is not going to need
                            any heap (apart from direct global init xalloc
                            calls) in which case the first application call
                            to malloc etc. will xalloc all remaining xmem.

     The default allocation is s=32, a=0 which provides 128k bytes for system
     and the remainder (typically at least 128k) for application.

     Xmem allocation (via xalloc()) will only be performed on first allocation
     for the given memory space.  If either s or a is set to 0, then the
     application should ensure that all required calls to xalloc() have been
     completed before calling any functions in this library, otherwise such
     calls will fail since all xmem will have been allocated by this library.

     Since it can be difficult to anticipate mixed use of malloc and xalloc,
     if there are any problems with the application prematurely running out
     of memory, then s and a should be set to fixed values.  It is recommended
     that new applications make use of malloc.lib functions, since xalloc() is
     considered deprecated for application use.

	Other configuration macros:


     #define _MALLOC_SYS_EXIT_ON_ERROR 1
     #define _MALLOC_APP_EXIT_ON_ERROR 1

       If defined non-zero then any failure to
       allocate or reallocate memory will result in a runtime exception.
       Since many applications will not be able to tolerate failure of
       malloc, it is useful to set the _MALLOC_APP_EXIT_ON_ERROR
       macro to 1.  This has the benefit of eliminating error handling
       code which checks for null pointer returns from malloc.

       The default for _MALLOC_SYS_EXIT_ON_ERROR is 1, since exhaustion of
       system memory should be made obvious during development.  For
       production code, this may be set to zero in order to allow code to
       continue running rather than automatically rebooting.  The system code
       attempts to handle memory exhaustion, however this is not always
       desirable, so it is preferable to find out the worst-case _sys_malloc
       memory requirement during development, and code the application to
       stay within that bound.

       Similar considerations apply to _MALLOC_APP_EXIT_ON_ERROR.  This
       applies to malloc memory plus root memory allocations (if any).

       You can also use the MALLOC_FAILURE_ACTION macro (see original
       notes below) in order to specify a global failure action, or use
       the following macro

     #define _MALLOC_PRINT_FAIL

       If defined, make malloc failure call a stub routine which prints
       the available useful information when _sys_malloc fails.  If
       _MALLOC_AUDIT is defined, it dumps the allocated blocks.  This
       function is always 'debug' so you can also set a breakpoint on it
       and even continue execution to help locate the offending caller.
       If defined, it also prevents exiting on error (see above).

     #define _MALLOC_SYS_MEM_TYPE  XALLOC_NOTBB
     #define _MALLOC_APP_MEM_TYPE  XALLOC_NOTBB

       Define the type of xalloc() memory to allocate as the memory pool
       for each memory space.  Defaults to non-battery-backed.
       See the description of _xalloc() for possible choices.
       NOTE: on the Rabbit 6000, the default for system memory space is
       XALLOC_URAM.

     #define _MALLOC_HWM_STATS

       If defined, keep statistics on high water mark of allocation.  This
       is useful for checking that there are no memory leaks in an
       application.  Currently, this only applies to the system memory
       space.  Call _sys_malloc_stats() to dump the results at the
       appropriate point(s) in the program.

     #define _MALLOC_AUDIT

       If defined, automatically defines _MALLOC_HWM_STATS.  This changes
       _sys_malloc() etc. so that auditing information is added to each
       allocated block.  The audit information may be printed using the
       function _sys_print_audit().  This is very useful for detecting
       exactly which line and file of the source code is responsible for
       allocating each block, which helps to solve memory leak problems.

       This should only be enabled when debugging, since it adds a lot
       of overhead for a production program.

  This is a version (aka dlmalloc) of malloc/free/realloc written by
  Doug Lea and released to the public domain, as explained at
  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain.  Send questions,
  comments, complaints, performance data, etc to dl@cs.oswego.edu

* Version pre-2.8.4 Wed Mar 29 19:46:29 2006    (dl at gee)

   Note: There may be an updated version of this malloc obtainable at
           ftp://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc.c
         Check before installing!

* Quickstart

  This library is all in one file to simplify the most common usage:
  ftp it, compile it (-O3), and link it into another program. All of
  the compile-time options default to reasonable values for use on
  most platforms.  You might later want to step through various
  compile-time and dynamic tuning options.

  For convenience, an include file for code using this malloc is at:
     ftp://gee.cs.oswego.edu/pub/misc/malloc-2.8.3.h
  You don't really need this .h file unless you call functions not
  defined in your system include files.  The .h file contains only the
  excerpts from this file needed for using this malloc on ANSI C/C++
  systems, so long as you haven't changed compile-time options about
  naming and tuning parameters.  If you do, then you can create your
  own malloc.h that does include all settings by cutting at the point
  indicated below. Note that you may already by default be using a C
  library containing a malloc that is based on some version of this
  malloc (for example in linux). You might still want to use the one
  in this file to customize settings or to avoid overheads associated
  with library versions.

* Vital statistics:

  Supported pointer/m_size_t representation:       4 or 8 bytes
       m_size_t MUST be an unsigned type of the same width as
       pointers. (If you are using an ancient system that declares
       m_size_t as a signed type, or need it to be a different width
       than pointers, you can use a previous release of this malloc
       (e.g. 2.7.2) supporting these.)

  Alignment:                                     8 bytes (default)
       Forced to 8 for Rabbit, since any larger is counterproductive.

  Minimum overhead per allocated chunk:   4 or  8 bytes (if 4byte sizes)
                                          8 or 16 bytes (if 8byte sizes)
       Each malloced chunk has a hidden word of overhead holding size
       and status information, and additional cross-check word
       if MALLOC_FOOTERS is defined.

  Minimum allocated size: 4-byte ptrs:  16 bytes    (including overhead)
                          8-byte ptrs:  32 bytes    (including overhead)

       Even a request for zero bytes (i.e., malloc(0)) returns a
       pointer to something of the minimum allocatable size.
       The maximum overhead wastage (i.e., number of extra bytes
       allocated than were requested in malloc) is less than or equal
       to the minimum size.

  Security: static-safe; optionally more or less
       The "security" of malloc refers to the ability of malicious
       code to accentuate the effects of errors (for example, freeing
       space that is not currently malloc'ed or overwriting past the
       ends of chunks) in code that calls malloc.  This malloc
       guarantees not to modify any memory locations below the base of
       heap, i.e., static variables, even in the presence of usage
       errors.  The routines additionally detect most improper frees
       and reallocs.  All this holds as long as the static bookkeeping
       for malloc itself is not corrupted by some other means.  This
       is only one aspect of security -- these checks do not, and
       cannot, detect all possible programming errors.

       If MALLOC_FOOTERS is defined nonzero, then each allocated chunk
       carries an additional check word to verify that it was malloced
       from its space.  These check words are the same within each
       execution of a program using malloc, but differ across
       executions, so externally crafted fake chunks cannot be
       freed. This improves security by rejecting frees/reallocs that
       could corrupt heap memory, in addition to the checks preventing
       writes to statics that are always on.  This may further improve
       security at the expense of time and space overhead.  (Note that
       MALLOC_FOOTERS may also be worth using with MSPACES.)

       By default detected errors cause the program to abort (calling
       "abort()"). You can override this to instead proceed past
       errors by defining PROCEED_ON_ERROR.  In this case, a bad free
       has no effect, and a malloc that encounters a bad address
       caused by user overwrites will ignore the bad address by
       dropping pointers and indices to all known memory. This may
       be appropriate for programs that should continue if at all
       possible in the face of programming errors, although they may
       run out of memory because dropped memory is never reclaimed.

       If you don't like either of these options, you can define
       CORRUPTION_ERROR_ACTION and USAGE_ERROR_ACTION to do anything
       else. And if if you are sure that your program using malloc has
       no errors or vulnerabilities, you can define MALLOC_NO_CHECK to 1,
       which might (or might not) provide a small performance improvement.

  Thread-safety: NOT thread-safe unless MALLOC_USE_LOCKS defined
       When MALLOC_USE_LOCKS is defined, each public call to malloc, free,
       etc is surrounded with either a pthread mutex or a win32
       spinlock (depending on WIN32). This is not especially fast, and
       can be a major bottleneck.  It is designed only to provide
       minimal protection in concurrent environments, and to provide a
       basis for extensions.  If you are using malloc in a concurrent
       program, consider instead using nedmalloc
       (http://www.nedprod.com/programs/portable/nedmalloc/) or
       ptmalloc (See http://www.malloc.de), which are derived
       from versions of this malloc.


  Compliance: I believe it is compliant with the Single Unix Specification
       (See http://www.unix.org). Also SVID/XPG, ANSI C, and probably
       others as well.

* Overview of algorithms

  This is not the fastest, most space-conserving, most portable, or
  most tunable malloc ever written. However it is among the fastest
  while also being among the most space-conserving, portable and
  tunable.  Consistent balance across these factors results in a good
  general-purpose allocator for malloc-intensive programs.

  In most ways, this malloc is a best-fit allocator. Generally, it
  chooses the best-fitting existing chunk for a request, with ties
  broken in approximately least-recently-used order. (This strategy
  normally maintains low fragmentation.) However, for requests less
  than 256bytes, it deviates from best-fit when there is not an
  exactly fitting available chunk by preferring to use space adjacent
  to that used for the previous small request, as well as by breaking
  ties in approximately most-recently-used order. (These enhance
  locality of series of small allocations.)  And for very large requests
  (>= 256Kb by default), it relies on system memory mapping
  facilities, if supported.  (This helps avoid carrying around and
  possibly fragmenting memory used only for large chunks.)

  All operations (except malloc_stats and mallinfo) have execution
  times that are bounded by a constant factor of the number of bits in
  a m_size_t, not counting any clearing in calloc or copying in realloc,
  or actions surrounding MORECORE that have times
  proportional to the number of non-contiguous regions returned by
  system allocation routines, which is often just 1. In real-time
  applications, you can optionally suppress segment traversals using
  NO_SEGMENT_TRAVERSAL, which assures bounded execution even when
  system allocators return non-contiguous spaces, at the typical
  expense of carrying around more memory and increased fragmentation.

  The implementation is not very modular and seriously overuses
  macros. Perhaps someday all C compilers will do as good a job
  inlining modular code as can now be done by brute-force expansion,
  but now, enough of them seem not to.

  Some compilers issue a lot of warnings about code that is
  dead/unreachable only on some platforms, and also about intentional
  uses of negation on unsigned types. All known cases of each can be
  ignored.

  For a longer but out of date high-level description, see
     http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

* MSPACES  (Rabbit note: this is forced to be true)
  If MSPACES is defined, then in addition to malloc, free, etc.,
  this file also defines mspace_malloc, mspace_free, etc. These
  are versions of malloc routines that take an "mspace" argument
  obtained using create_mspace_with_base, to control all internal bookkeeping.
  If ONLY_MSPACES is defined, only these versions are compiled.
  So if you would like to use this allocator for only some allocations,
  and your system malloc for others, you can compile with
  ONLY_MSPACES and then do something like...
    static mspace mymspace = create_mspace(0,0); // for example
    #define mymalloc(bytes)  mspace_malloc(mymspace, bytes)

  (Note: If you only need one instance of an mspace, you can instead
  use "USE_DL_PREFIX" to relabel the global malloc.)

  You can similarly create thread-local allocators by storing
  mspaces as thread-locals. For example:
    static __thread mspace tlms = 0;
    m_voidptr  tlmalloc(m_size_t bytes) {
      if (tlms == 0) tlms = create_mspace(0, 0);
      return mspace_malloc(tlms, bytes);
    }
    void  tlfree(m_voidptr mem) { mspace_free(tlms, mem); }

  Unless MALLOC_FOOTERS is defined, each mspace is completely independent.
  You cannot allocate from one and free to another (although
  conformance is only weakly checked, so usage errors are not always
  caught). If MALLOC_FOOTERS is defined, then each chunk carries around a tag
  indicating its originating mspace, and frees are directed to their
  originating spaces.

 -------------------------  Compile-time options ---------------------------

Be careful in setting #define values for numerical constants of type
m_size_t. On some systems, literal values are not automatically extended
to m_size_t precision unless they are explicitly casted. You can also
use the symbolic values MAX_SIZE_T, SIZE_T_ONE, etc below.


MALLOC_ALIGNMENT         default: (m_size_t)8
  Rabbit forces this to 8.
  Controls the minimum alignment for malloc'ed chunks.  It must be a
  power of two and at least 8, even on machines for which smaller
  alignments would suffice. It may be defined as larger than this
  though. Note however that code and data structures are optimized for
  the case of 8-byte alignment.

MSPACES
ONLY_MSPACES
	Rabbit implementation forces these to be true.

MALLOC_USE_LOCKS                default: 0 (false)
  Causes each call to each public routine to be surrounded with
  pthread or WIN32 mutex lock/unlock. (If set true, this can be
  overridden on a per-mspace basis for mspace versions.) If set to a
  non-zero value other than 1, locks are used, but their
  implementation is left out, so lock functions must be supplied manually.

MALLOC_FOOTERS                  default: 0
  If true, provide extra checking and dispatching by placing
  information in the footers of allocated chunks. This adds
  space and time overhead.

MALLOC_NO_CHECK                 default: 0
  If true, omit checks for usage errors and heap space overwrites.

USE_DL_PREFIX            default: NOT defined
  Causes compiler to prefix all public routines with the string 'dl'.
  This can be useful when you only want to use this malloc in one part
  of a program, using your regular system malloc elsewhere.

MALLOC_ABORT                    default: defined as exit(-ENOMEM)
  Defines how to abort on failed checks.  On most systems, a failed
  check cannot die with an "assert" or even print an informative
  message, because the underlying print routines in turn call malloc,
  which will fail again.  Generally, the best policy is to simply call
  abort(). It's not very useful to do more than this because many
  errors due to overwriting will show up as address faults (null, odd
  addresses etc) rather than malloc-triggered checks, so will also
  abort.  Also, most compilers know that abort() does not return, so
  can better optimize code conditionally calling it.

PROCEED_ON_ERROR           default: defined as 0 (false)
  Controls whether detected bad addresses cause them to bypassed
  rather than aborting. If set, detected bad arguments to free and
  realloc are ignored. And all bookkeeping information is zeroed out
  upon a detected overwrite of freed heap space, thus losing the
  ability to ever return it from malloc again, but enabling the
  application to proceed. If PROCEED_ON_ERROR is defined, the
  static variable malloc_corruption_error_count is compiled in
  and can be examined to see if errors have occurred. This option
  generates slower code than the default abort policy.

MALLOC_DEBUG                    default: NOT defined
  The DEBUG setting is mainly intended for people trying to modify
  this code or diagnose problems when porting to new platforms.
  However, it may also be able to better isolate user errors than just
  using runtime checks.  The assertions in the check routines spell
  out in more detail the assumptions and invariants underlying the
  algorithms.  The checking is fairly extensive, and will slow down
  execution noticeably. Calling malloc_stats or mallinfo with DEBUG
  set will attempt to check every allocated and free chunk
  in the course of computing the summaries.

ABORT_ON_ASSERT_FAILURE   default: defined as 0 (false)
  Debugging assertion failures can be nearly impossible if your
  version of the assert macro causes malloc to be called, which will
  lead to a cascade of further failures, blowing the runtime stack.
  ABORT_ON_ASSERT_FAILURE cause assertions failures to call abort(),
  which will usually make debugging easier.

MALLOC_FAILURE_ACTION     default: sets errno to ENOMEM, or no-op on win32
  The action to take before "return 0" when malloc fails to be able to
  return memory because there is none available.

HAVE_MORECORE
	Rabbit implementation forces this to be false

MORECORE                  default: sbrk
  The name of the sbrk-style system routine to call to obtain more
  memory.  See below for guidance on writing custom MORECORE
  functions. The type of the argument to sbrk/MORECORE varies across
  systems.  It cannot be m_size_t, because it supports negative
  arguments, so it is normally the signed type of the same width as
  m_size_t (sometimes declared as "intptr_t").  It doesn't much matter
  though. Internally, we only call it with arguments less than half
  the max value of a m_size_t, which should work across all reasonable
  possibilities, although sometimes generating compiler warnings.  See
  near the end of this file for guidelines for creating a custom
  version of MORECORE.

MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS       default: 1 (true) if HAVE_MORECORE
	Rabbit implementation forces this to be false, since do not support sbrk.

MORECORE_CANNOT_TRIM      default: NOT defined
  Not relevant for Rabbit

NO_SEGMENT_TRAVERSAL       default: 0
  If non-zero, suppresses traversals of memory segments
  returned by MORECORE. This disables
  merging of segments that are contiguous, and selectively
  releasing them to the OS if unused, but bounds execution times.



MALLOC_PAGESIZE         default: 4096.
  The system page size. To the extent possible, this malloc manages
  memory from the system in page-size units.  This may be (and
  usually is) a function rather than a constant.

NO_MALLINFO                default: 1
	Rabbit implementation forces this to be true.  Even if defined
	otherwise, mallinfo support is not available.

MALLINFO_FIELD_TYPE        default: m_size_t
  The type of the fields in the mallinfo struct. This was originally
  defined as "int" in SVID etc, but is more usefully defined as
  m_size_t. The value is used only if  HAVE_USR_INCLUDE_MALLOC_H is not set

REALLOC_ZERO_BYTES_FREES    default: not defined
  This should be set if a call to realloc with zero bytes should
  be the same as a call to free. Some people think it should. Otherwise,
  since this malloc returns a unique pointer for malloc(0), so does
  realloc(p, 0).


DEFAULT_GRANULARITY        default: page size if MORECORE_CONTIGUOUS,
                                otherwise 64K.
	Not relevant to Rabbit.

/*
  (The following includes lightly edited explanations by Colin Plumb.)

  The malloc_chunk declaration below is misleading (but accurate and
  necessary).  It declares a "view" into memory allowing access to
  necessary fields at known offsets from a given base.

  Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
  originally described by Knuth.  (See the paper by Paul Wilson
  ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/garbage/allocsrv.ps for a survey of such
  techniques.)  Sizes of free chunks are stored both in the front of
  each chunk and at the end.  This makes consolidating fragmented
  chunks into bigger chunks fast.  The head fields also hold bits
  representing whether chunks are free or in use.

  Here are some pictures to make it clearer.  They are "exploded" to
  show that the state of a chunk can be thought of as extending from
  the high 31 bits of the head field of its header through the
  prev_foot and PINUSE_BIT bit of the following chunk header.

  A chunk that's in use looks like:

   chunk-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
           | Size of previous chunk (if P = 1)                             |
           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |P|
         | Size of this chunk                                         1| +-+
   mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |                                                               |
         +-                                                             -+
         |                                                               |
         +-                                                             -+
         |                                                               :
         +-      size - sizeof(m_size_t) available payload bytes          -+
         :                                                               |
 chunk-> +-                                                             -+
         |                                                               |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ |1|
       | Size of next chunk (may or may not be in use)               | +-+
 mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    And if it's free, it looks like this:

   chunk-> +-                                                             -+

   mem-> +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         +-      size - sizeof(struct chunk) unused bytes               -+

       +- User payload                                                -+
       :                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                                                     |0|
                                                                     +-+
  Note that since we always merge adjacent free chunks, the chunks
  adjacent to a free chunk must be in use.

  Given a pointer to a chunk (which can be derived trivially from the
  payload pointer) we can, in O(1) time, find out whether the adjacent
  chunks are free, and if so, unlink them from the lists that they
  are on and merge them with the current chunk.

  Chunks always begin on even word boundaries, so the mem portion
  (which is returned to the user) is also on an even word boundary, and
  thus at least double-word aligned.

  The P (PINUSE_BIT) bit, stored in the unused low-order bit of the
  chunk size (which is always a multiple of two words), is an in-use
  bit for the *previous* chunk.  If that bit is *clear*, then the
  word before the current chunk size contains the previous chunk
  size, and can be used to find the front of the previous chunk.
  The very first chunk allocated always has this bit set, preventing
  access to non-existent (or non-owned) memory. If pinuse is set for
  any given chunk, then you CANNOT determine the size of the
  previous chunk, and might even get a memory addressing fault when
  trying to do so.

  The C (CINUSE_BIT) bit, stored in the unused second-lowest bit of
  the chunk size redundantly records whether the current chunk is
  inuse. This redundancy enables usage checks within free and realloc,
  and reduces indirection when freeing and consolidating chunks.

  Each freshly allocated chunk must have both cinuse and pinuse set.
  That is, each allocated chunk borders either a previously allocated
  and still in-use chunk, or the base of its memory arena. This is
  ensured by making all allocations from the the `lowest' part of any
  found chunk.  Further, no free chunk physically borders another one,
  so each free chunk is known to be preceded and followed by either
  inuse chunks or the ends of memory.

  Note that the `foot' of the current chunk is actually represented
  as the prev_foot of the NEXT chunk. This makes it easier to
  deal with alignments etc but can be very confusing when trying
  to extend or adapt this code.

  The exceptions to all this are

     1. The special chunk `top' is the top-most available chunk (i.e.,
        the one bordering the end of available memory). It is treated
        specially.  Top is never included in any bin, is used only if
        no other chunk is available, and is released back to the
        system if it is very large (see M_TRIM_THRESHOLD).  In effect,
        the top chunk is treated as larger (and thus less well
        fitting) than any other available chunk.  The top chunk
        doesn't update its trailing size field since there is no next
        contiguous chunk that would have to index off it. However,
        space is still allocated for it (TOP_FOOT_SIZE) to enable
        separation or merging when space is extended.

  Larger chunks are kept in a form of bitwise digital trees (aka
  tries) keyed on chunksizes.  Because malloc_tree_chunks are only for
  free chunks greater than 256 bytes, their size doesn't impose any
  constraints on user chunk sizes.  Each node looks like:

  Each tree holding treenodes is a tree of unique chunk sizes.  Chunks
  of the same size are arranged in a circularly-linked list, with only
  the oldest chunk (the next to be used, in our FIFO ordering)
  actually in the tree.  (Tree members are distinguished by a non-null
  parent pointer.)  If a chunk with the same size an an existing node
  is inserted, it is linked off the existing node using pointers that
  work in the same way as fd/bk pointers of small chunks.

  Each tree contains a power of 2 sized range of chunk sizes (the
  smallest is 0x100 <= x < 0x180), which is is divided in half at each
  tree level, with the chunks in the smaller half of the range (0x100
  <= x < 0x140 for the top nose) in the left subtree and the larger
  half (0x140 <= x < 0x180) in the right subtree.  This is, of course,
  done by inspecting individual bits.

  Using these rules, each node's left subtree contains all smaller
  sizes than its right subtree.  However, the node at the root of each
  subtree has no particular ordering relationship to either.  (The
  dividing line between the subtree sizes is based on trie relation.)
  If we remove the last chunk of a given size from the interior of the
  tree, we need to replace it with a leaf node.  The tree ordering
  rules permit a node to be replaced by any leaf below it.

  The smallest chunk in a tree (a common operation in a best-fit
  allocator) can be found by walking a path to the leftmost leaf in
  the tree.  Unlike a usual binary tree, where we follow left child
  pointers until we reach a null, here we follow the right child
  pointer any time the left one is null, until we reach a leaf with
  both child pointers null. The smallest chunk in the tree will be
  somewhere along that path.

  The worst case number of steps to add, find, or remove a node is
  bounded by the number of bits differentiating chunks within
  bins. Under current bin calculations, this ranges from 6 up to 21
  (for 32 bit sizes) or up to 53 (for 64 bit sizes). The typical case
  is of course much better.

/*
  Each malloc space may include non-contiguous segments, held in a
  list headed by an embedded malloc_segment record representing the
  top-most space. Segments also include flags holding properties of
  the space.


  Management entails a simpler variant of the consolidation scheme
  used for chunks to reduce fragmentation -- new adjacent memory is
  normally prepended or appended to an existing segment. However,
  there are limitations compared to chunk consolidation that mostly
  reflect the fact that segment processing is relatively infrequent
  (occurring only when getting memory from system) and that we
  don't expect to have huge numbers of segments:

  * Segments are not indexed, so traversal requires linear scans.  (It
    would be possible to index these, but is not worth the extra
    overhead and complexity for most programs on most platforms.)
  * New segments are only appended to old ones when holding top-most
    memory; if they cannot be prepended to others, they are held in
    different segments.

  Except for the top-most segment of an mstate, each segment record
  is kept at the tail of its segment. Segments are added by pushing
  segment records onto the list headed by &mstate.seg for the
  containing mstate.

  Segment flags control allocation/merge/deallocation policies:
  * If MALLOC_EXTERN_BIT set, then we did not allocate this segment,
    and so should not try to deallocate or merge with others.
    (This currently holds only for the initial segment passed
    into create_mspace_with_base.)
  * Else the segment was obtained using
    MORECORE so can be merged with surrounding MORECORE'd segments
    and deallocated/trimmed using MORECORE with negative arguments.

/* ---------------------------- malloc_state ----------------------------- */

/*
   A malloc_state holds all of the bookkeeping for a space.
   The main fields are:

  Top
    The topmost chunk of the currently active segment. Its size is
    cached in topsize.  The actual size of topmost space is
    topsize+TOP_FOOT_SIZE, which includes space reserved for adding
    fenceposts and segment records if necessary when getting more
    space from the system.

  Designated victim (dv)
    This is the preferred chunk for servicing small requests that
    don't have exact fits.  It is normally the chunk split off most
    recently to service another small request.  Its size is cached in
    dvsize. The link fields of this chunk are not maintained since it
    is not kept in a bin.

  SmallBins
    An array of bin headers for free chunks.  These bins hold chunks
    with sizes less than MIN_LARGE_SIZE bytes. Each bin contains
    chunks of all the same size, spaced 8 bytes apart.  To simplify
    use in double-linked lists, each bin header acts as a malloc_chunk
    pointing to the real first node, if it exists (else pointing to
    itself).  This avoids special-casing for headers.  But to avoid
    waste, we allocate only the fd/bk pointers of bins, and then use
    repositioning tricks to treat these as the fields of a chunk.

  TreeBins
    Treebins are pointers to the roots of trees holding a range of
    sizes. There are 2 equally spaced treebins for each power of two
    from TREE_SHIFT to TREE_SHIFT+16. The last bin holds anything
    larger.

  Bin maps
    There is one bit map for small bins ("smallmap") and one for
    treebins ("treemap).  Each bin sets its bit when non-empty, and
    clears the bit when empty.  Bit operations are then used to avoid
    bin-by-bin searching -- nearly all "search" is done without ever
    looking at bins that won't be selected.  The bit maps
    conservatively use 32 bits per map word, even if on 64bit system.
    For a good description of some of the bit-based techniques used
    here, see Henry S. Warren Jr's book "Hacker's Delight" (and
    supplement at http://hackersdelight.org/). Many of these are
    intended to reduce the branchiness of paths through malloc etc, as
    well as to reduce the number of memory locations read or written.

  Segments
    A list of segments headed by an embedded malloc_segment record
    representing the initial space.

  Address check support
    The least_addr field is the least address ever obtained from
    MORECORE. Attempted frees and reallocs of any address less
    than this are trapped (unless MALLOC_NO_CHECK is defined).

  Magic tag
    A cross-check field that should always hold same value as mparams.magic.

  Flags
    Bits recording whether to use locks, or contiguous MORECORE

  Statistics
    Each space keeps track of current and maximum system memory
    obtained via MORECORE.

  Trim support
    Fields holding the amount of unused topmost memory that should trigger
    timming, and a counter to force periodic scanning to release unused
    non-topmost segments.

  Locking
    If MALLOC_USE_LOCKS is defined, the "mutex" lock is acquired and released
    around every public call using this mspace.

  Extension support
    A m_voidptr pointer and a m_size_t field that can be used to help implement
    extensions to this malloc.

/*
  For security, the main invariant is that malloc/free/etc never
  writes to a static address other than malloc_state, unless static
  malloc_state itself has been corrupted, which cannot occur via
  malloc (because of these checks). In essence this means that we
  believe all pointers, sizes, maps etc held in malloc_state, but
  check all of those linked or offsetted from other embedded data
  structures.  These checks are interspersed with main code in a way
  that tends to minimize their run-time cost.

  When MALLOC_FOOTERS is defined, in addition to range checking, we also
  verify footer fields of inuse chunks, which can be used guarantee
  that the mstate controlling malloc/free is intact.  This is a
  streamlined version of the approach described by William Robertson
  et al in "Run-time Detection of Heap-based Overflows" LISA'03
  http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa03/tech/robertson.html The footer
  of an inuse chunk holds the xor of its mstate and a random seed,
  that is checked upon calls to free() and realloc().  This is
  (probablistically) unguessable from outside the program, but can be
  computed by any code successfully malloc'ing any chunk, so does not
  itself provide protection against code that has already broken
  security through some other means.  Unlike Robertson et al, we
  always dynamically check addresses of all offset chunks (previous,
  next, etc). This turns out to be cheaper than relying on hashes.

/*
  Unlink steps:

  1. If x is a chained node, unlink it from its same-sized fd/bk links
     and choose its bk node as its replacement.
  2. If x was the last node of its size, but not a leaf node, it must
     be replaced with a leaf node (not merely one with an open left or
     right), to make sure that lefts and rights of descendents
     correspond properly to bit masks.  We use the rightmost descendent
     of x.  We could use any other leaf, but this is easy to locate and
     tends to counteract removal of leftmosts elsewhere, and so keeps
     paths shorter than minimally guaranteed.  This doesn't loop much
     because on average a node in a tree is near the bottom.
  3. If x is the base of a chain (i.e., has parent links) relink
     x's parent and children to x's replacement (or null if none).

      * Integrated most documentation with the code.
      * Add support for mmap, with help from
        Wolfram Gloger (Gloger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de).
      * Use last_remainder in more cases.

      * Re-tuned and fixed to behave more nicely with V2.6.0 changes.
      * Removed all preallocation code since under current scheme
        the work required to undo bad preallocations exceeds
        the work saved in good cases for most test programs.
      * No longer use return list or unconsolidated bins since
        no scheme using them consistently outperforms those that don't
        given above changes.
      * Use best fit for very large chunks to prevent some worst-cases.
      * Added some support for debugging

    V2.5.2 Tue Apr  5 16:20:40 1994  Doug Lea  (dl at g)
      * realloc: try to expand in both directions
      * malloc: swap order of clean-bin strategy;
      * realloc: only conditionally expand backwards
      * Try not to scavenge used bins
      * Use bin counts as a guide to preallocation
      * Occasionally bin return list chunks in first scan
      * Add a few optimizations from colin@nyx10.cs.du.edu

    V2.5.1 Sat Aug 14 15:40:43 1993  Doug Lea  (dl at g)
      * faster bin computation & slightly different binning
      * merged all consolidations to one part of malloc proper
         (eliminating old malloc_find_space & malloc_clean_bin)
      * Scan 2 returns chunks (not just 1)
      * Propagate failure in realloc if malloc returns 0
      * Add stuff to allow compilation on non-ANSI compilers
          from kpv@research.att.com

      * removed potential for odd address access in prev_chunk
      * removed dependency on getpagesize.h
      * misc cosmetics and a bit more internal documentation
      * anticosmetics: mangled names in macros to evade debugger strangeness
      * tested on sparc, hp-700, dec-mips, rs6000
          with gcc & native cc (hp, dec only) allowing
          Detlefs & Zorn comparison study (in SIGPLAN Notices.)

    Trial version Fri Aug 28 13:14:29 1992  Doug Lea  (dl at g.oswego.edu)
      * Based loosely on libg++-1.2X malloc. (It retains some of the overall
         structure of old version,  but most details differ.)
