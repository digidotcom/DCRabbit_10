               Dynamic C for Rabbit Release Notes

*****************************************************************
Reminder: When opening a project in a new version of Dynamic C,
update the "Include Path" tab in the Project Options to use the
new Dynamic C directory.  (Or change it to ".\include" to always
use the current compiler's include directory.)
*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.72D - unreleased

The primary focus of this release is to address the Key Reinstallation
Attacks (KRACK) against WPA2.  Dynamic C includes two versions of
wpa_supplicant -- v0.2.8 used when WPA_USE_EAP isn't defined and
v0.5.11 for when it is.  This release updates to the last stable
release of each series and patches them to block the KRACKs.

The release also addresses routing problems present on RCM66xxW
modules that enable both Ethernet and Wi-Fi interfaces.

NEW FEATURES

BUG FIXES

- DC-255: Updated change from 10.72B release related to IP address
  reuse during PPP handshaking.  Users can re-enable the disabled
  feature by defining IPCP_ENABLE_IPADDR_REUSE.
- DC-337: Store correct value for freq_divider.  Was previously one
  less than the correct value which would affect baud rate
  calculations.
- DC-344: Fix error when setting default Wi-Fi router when also
  using Ethernet.
- DC-345: Fix behavior of IFG_WIFI_MODE option to ifconfig().
- DC-346: Fix default route when using both Ethernet and Wi-Fi.
- DC-349: Fix WPA2 KRACK vulnerability.
- DC-357: Document compiler error (aborts compilation of valid code)
  in README.TXT as "Known Issue #31".

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES


*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.72C - August 31, 2017

This release adds support for SDHC media (4GB to 32GB cards) now that
SD cards are difficult to find, a keypad/display unit that only worked
with Dynamic C 9, and a new member of the RCM4300 series, the RCM4320.

TLS clients now send a Server Name Indication (SNI), required when
a single IP address hosts multiple certificates based on hostname.
They now also parse the subjectAltName field from X.509 certificates
and use it for hostname validation.

WARNING: If using I2C with Dynamic C 10.72B on Rabbit 6000, you must
update your calls to I2CRead() and I2CWrite() to pass the slave address
in bits 1-7 instead of bits 0-6 of the first parameter.  This release
restores compatibility with software-based I2C from Dynamic C 10.72A
and earlier.  In addition, the APIs for I2C_ReadFromSlave() and
I2C_WriteToSlave() now include an index parameter so I2C_ReadFromSlave()
can send a START, SLAVE_WRITE, INDEX, START, SLAVE_READ sequence for
efficient reads.  Use the new CC_REV compiler macro to conditionally
compile code so it can work with new and old APIs.

NEW FEATURES

- Adds support for RCM4320 variant -- an RCM4310 with 1MB of SRAM
  for firmware (instead of 512KB) and a 4MB serial flash for storage
  (instead of 1MB).
- Updated sdflash.lib to support SDHC cards from 4GB to 32GB.  Note
  that Dynamic C still does not support FAT32.  When using SDHC cards
  you must format them on the Rabbit with up to four FAT16 partitions,
  but you can still read and write them on Mac/Windows/Linux.
  Email Jim.Pause@digi.com if interested in FAT32 support in Dynamic C.
- Updated FAT16.lib to work on SDHC cards (larger than 2GB).
- Updated TLS to send Server Name Indication (SNI) in ClientHello.
  Includes updates to HTTP, SMTP and POP3 client libraries.
- Updated X.509 certificate handling to process subjectAltName
  extension, allowing for improved hostname matching in TLS client
  connections.
- Defined a CC_REV macro as 'C' for use in compiler version checks.
- Added RCM6xxx support for Panel-Mount Keypad/Display Unit (Digi part
  number 20-101-0502).

BUG FIXES

- Addresses compiler errors with I2C_HW.LIB for Rabbit 6000 boards.
- HTTP client now sends correct Content-Type on non-blocking PUT/POST.
- Moved duplicated MODBUS_CRC() from modbus_{master,slave}.lib to
  CRC16.LIB.
- Updated FTP server samples to work with default FileZilla FTP client
  settings.
- DC-295: Get_Stack_Size() returns correct size instead of smallest
  stack size.
- DC-304: After DHCP fallback, further DHCP discovery would fail.
- DC-310: Revert commit that incorrectly processed slave address in
  I2CRead() and I2CWrite() calls on Rabbit 6000 hardware with DC 10.72B.
- DC-317: Correctly set interrupt level when RS232_INT_LEVEL != 1.
- DC-322: Don't hard-code keysize in AES{en,de}cryptStream_CBC()
  and _CBC_XMEM() functions.  Now works correctly for AES-192/256.
- DC-332: Fix Rabbit 6000 link recovery, broken in pre-release 10.72C.
- DC-334: Ignore non-fatal "warning" TLS alerts intead of aborting
  connection.
- GITHUB-13: Fix return value of _n_strcpy().
- GITHUB-14: Fix bug in httpc_skip_headers() for non-blocking
  connections.
- RCM-143: Only call dhcp_tick() if interface is up.
- RCM-143: When Ethernet powered down, link status should always be
  "down" (changed for Rabbit 6000 and ASIX-based hardware).

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- Disabled incomplete I2C slave mode for Rabbit 6000 hardware.
- Please note that while all Rabbit MAC addresses have previously
  used an OUI (manufacturer code) of 00:90:C2, future products may
  ship with an alternate OUI.  Please be proactive and replace any
  code that requires that byte sequence.
- Added "Known Issue" about compiler errors/warnings in files that
  exceed 32,767 lines.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.72B - October 31, 2016

This release builds upon the TLS 1.2 update in Dynamic C 10.72A,
by adding support for SHA384 and SHA512 hashes in TLS communications
and X.509 certificates.  It also brings back support for TLS 1.0 in
outbound client connections to support legacy servers that have not
implemented TLS 1.2 yet.  Details in function help for TCPCONFIG,
tls_set_flags(), httpc_set_tls(), pop3_set_tls(), and smtp_set_tls().

There's an important update to ASIX.LIB which should finally
resolve all outstanding link recovery issues.

All of the "iDigi" libraries, APIs and samples were renamed to
match the current "Device Cloud" name for that service.

NEW FEATURES
- Adds support for SHA384/SHA512 hashes:
  - New library and updated sample.
  - TLS update to support for SHA384 and SHA512 hashes.
  - X.509 update to support sha224, sha384 and sha512 signatures.

- Adds support for falling back to TLS 1.0 on outbound (client)
  TLS connections.

- Adds source code and tools for building binaries in BIOS directory
  (cold loaders and pilot BIOSes).

- Adds sample for run-from-RAM boards to download a copy of the boot
  flash via HTTP.  Useful for firmware recovery and analysis of flash
  contents.

- Improves boot time on 6000-based hardware (now < 1 second) when
  _FAST_BIOS_LOAD macro defined in Project Options [DC-269].

- Replaces the outdated SSL Certificate Creation GUI (in
  Utilities/SSL_Utilities) with command-line OpenSSL version 1.0.2j.
  Added instructions on using OpenSSL to create certificates, which
  should allow for more control over key size and choice of hashing
  algorithm.

BUG FIXES
- Corrected compilation errors when X509_VERBOSE or WPA_VERBOSE defined.
- Fix bug in http_finderrbuf() affecting variable names longer than
  SSPEC_MAXSPEC characters.
- DC-216: Update I2C for Rabbit 6000 hardware.
- DC-255: Disabled IP address reuse during negotiation of PPP
  connections with other active interfaces (e.g. Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
- DC-260: Improve ASIX Ethernet link recovery by allowing more time
  to establish link after turning PHY back on (8s vs. 2s).
- DC-264: IIS servers require signature_algorithms extension in TLS
  Client Hello.
- DC-264: Increase TCP receive buffer size to account for additional
  TLS 1.2 overhead.
- DC-267: FTP server incorrectly stripped leading slash from absolute
  pathnames in STOR, MKD and RMD commands.
- DC-275: Disable attempted lease renewal for permanent DHCP leases.
- DC-280: Fix for serial connections with 2 stop bits.  First byte was
  always sent with 1 stop bit.
- DC-281: Correct invalid JSON generated by web_iter_next() (RabbitWeb).
- DC-283: Repeatedly setting a gateway then deleting all routers no
  longer fills APR cache.
- DC-285: Fix possible overflow when calculating PMKSA reauth timeout
  for WPA/WPA2 Enterprise Wi-Fi connections.
- DC-287: Fix for FTP client uploading files using a datahandler instead
  of a fixed-length buffer (broken by DC-129 in Dynamic C 10.72A).
- DC-290: Ensure that SSL_set_private_key() always returns error upon
  failure to parse key.
- GITHUB-7/DC-265: Handle Ethernet netport interrupt on 6000-based
  hardware so transmit errors don't hold buffers forever.
- RCM-77: Improve Ethernet link recovery on 5000/6000-based hardware.
- RCM-121: Fix buffer overflow caused by large packets on WPA/TKIP
  (but not WPA2/CCMP) networks.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
- Update samples using SSL_Cert_t to store certs in far memory and
  not on the stack.
- Optimization from petermcs to reduce code size and speed execution
  of sha256_process() in SHA2.LIB.
- DC-268: Changed some function variables in FTP server from "static"
  to "auto".
- DC-284: Updated firmware_info_t structure to include compiler revision.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.72A - March 17, 2016

The big change for this release is that Dynamic C is now an Open
Source project on GitHub (https://github.com/digidotcom/DCRabbit_10).
It includes source code to the previously-encrypted Wi-Fi and SSL
libraries, and the license was changed to MPL 2.0 (Libraries) and
ISC (Samples).

This release was made as 10.72A since it does not include changes to
the compiler and only contains modified libraries, samples and
documentation.  It uses shortcuts (.lnk files) to launch the compiler
with a command-line parameter of "-c A", forcing the compiler to
identify itself as 10.72A and use registry entries for version 10.72A.

The installer is also smaller, due to the removal of an outdated XCTU
installer, the "XBee GPIO GUI" utility/source (designed for sample
programs removed in the 10.70 release), and a Microsoft .NET installer
(dotnetfx.exe) required by that utility.

You can download the latest version of X-CTU from:

        http://www.digi.com/xctu


NEW FEATURES

- Includes library and utility programs to write a System ID Block
  to a device's flash (Utilities/Write_ID).

- Incorporates NAND flash library patch (40002851_A, 2012-12-01) for
  Micron/Numonyx/ST NAND256W3A (32MB) devices used in new hardware.

- Incorporates Serial Flash update (40002882_A) for revision E of 
  45DB641 chips used in new hardware.

- Add httpc_set_extra_headers() API to HTTPC.LIB for user code to
  add headers to outbound requests.

- Upgrades TLS (Transport Layer Security, aka SSL/HTTPS)
  implementation from 1.0 to 1.2.
  - Is compatible with modern web browsers.
  - Removes support for insecure SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 protocols.
  - Removes support for insecure RC4 cipher and MD5 digest.
  - Automatically enables required AES128_CBC cipher.
  - Defaults to 2048-bit RSA keys (previously 1024-bit).
  - Adds optional AES256_CBC cipher, SHA256 digests, and support for
    SHA256 signatures in X.509 (TLS/SSL) certificates.

BUG FIXES

- Fix conversion of RabbitWeb multi-select 32-bit enum to text.
  (contributed by titobrasolin).
- Initialize struct tm in _atodt() before use to avoid random
  hour/minute/second values affecting result (contributed by
  titobrasolin).

  multi-tasking) misplacement bug affecting Dynamic C versions 10.62
  through 10.72, inclusive.
- DC-78: Fix memory leaks in idigi_put() and idigi_upload().

- RCM-7: Don't reset TCP keepalive timer on reused connections.
- RCM-109: Fix issue preventing module from joining WPA mixed-mode
  (TKIP/CCMP) networks.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- The DMAETH100_AUTO_NEG_TIMEOUT macro is deprecated. Rabbit 5000
  or 6000 built-in Ethernet applications which use a custom
  definition for this macro should instead define one or both of
  the DMAETH100_LINKFAIL_TIMEOUT or DMAETH100_LINKDOWN_TIMEOUT
  macros.

  The *LINKFAIL* macro value determines the PHY powered-up time
  out for link-failed detection. The *LINKDOWN* macro value
  determines the PHY powered-down idle time-out for no-connect
  Ethernet current reduction. The default value for each of the
  *LINK* macros is 4000 miliiseconds, which results in a 50%
  powered-up vs. powered-down duty cycle when e.g. Ethernet is
  not connected.
  
*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.72

NEW FEATURES

- FCC-labeled versions of RCM6600W family boards are locked to
  the Americas region code.

- The following new options are available in the command line
  Rabbit Field Utility (Utilities\clRFU.exe):
    -i pathname Specify application binary image file, -i BinPath
    -si         Print formatted contents of System ID block
    -ma         Print formatted MAC address
    -bi         Print Board ID
    --boot-flashtype flash_type
                Specify flash_type as either parallel or serial
    --boot-memorywidth memory_width
                Specify memory_width (in bits) as either 8 or 16
    --boot-ram-selectenable mb0cr_value
                Specify mb0cr_value in the range [0,7]
                /CS0:3 in bits 1:0, /OE0:1 (== /WE0:1) in bit 2

  Previously, the command line RFU required that its first
  parameter must be the path name of the binary image to load to
  the Rabbit target board.

  Now, when the new "-i pathname" option is not specified, it is
  possible to check Rabbit board information via the new "-si"
  and / or "-ma" and / or "-bi" options without loading a binary
  image to the Rabbit target board.

- The Rabbit Field Utility, after successfully loading a binary
  image onto a Rabbit target board, now automatically starts
  program execution. RabbitBios.c has been updated to provide the
  following three behavior options after the RFU has started
  program execution:

  1) Default behavior. When neither RFU_BIN_RUN_IMMEDIATELY nor
     RFU_BIN_WAIT_FOR_RUN_MODE are defined, a BIN program image
     successfully loaded by RFU 4.72 or later will run BIOS code
     only and then will wait in an idle loop until a hardware
     reset occurs. Following a hardware reset and with the
     programming cable disconnected, BIOS code and user code will
     execute as usual.

     This mode of operation most closely emulates the behavior of
     RFU versions prior to 4.72. It can also be useful in test
     fixture code, for example, where a test fixture can control
     at least one of the SMODEx levels as well as the RESET
     level, and manual disconnection of the programming cable is
     inconvenient or undesirable.

  2) When RFU_BIN_RUN_IMMEDIATELY is defined in Dynamic C's
     Project Options' Defines tab, a BIN program image
     successfully loaded by RFU 4.72 or later will run both BIOS
     code and user code immediately after loading, with the
     programming cable still connected. With the programming
     cable disconnected, BIOS code and user code will execute as
     usual.

     This mode of operation is enforced when Dynamic C's debug
     kernel is enabled. It can also be useful in test fixture
     code, for example, where a test fixture can not or does not
     control the SMODEx levels and manual disconnection of the
     programming cable is inconvenient or undesirable.

  3) When RFU_BIN_WAIT_FOR_RUN_MODE is defined in Dynamic C's
     Project Options' Defines tab, a BIN program image
     successfully loaded by RFU 4.72 or later will run BIOS code
     and then pause in an idle loop, waiting for the programming
     cable to be disconnected. As soon as the programming cable
     is disconnected, user code will begin to execute. With the
     programming cable disconnected, BIOS code and user code will
     execute as usual.

     This mode of operation can be useful in test fixture code,
     for example, where a test fixture can control at least one
     of the SMODEx levels and manual disconnection of the
     programming cable is inconvenient or undesirable.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs

GUI Bugs

Library Bugs
- Defect #41708. Prevented possible program hang and possible
  false-positive file transfer success result in ftp_client.lib.
- Defect #41912. When HTTP_CUSTOM_HEADERS is defined and used, an
  incorrect buffer offset calculation results in corrupted HTTP
  header buffer content.
- Defect #42073. The digOutConfig_H() function in BLxS2xx.LIB now
  returns the expected 0 result on success.
- Defect #43173. Dynamic C's run time error reporting now
  consistently reports the return address on the stack when
  exception() is called.

  OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
- The Lib\Rabbit4000\NandFlash\nflash.lib driver library has been
  updated with support for Micron/Numonyx/ST NANDxxxW3A nand
  flash devices. Previously supported nand flash devices, used on
  RCM4000 and RCM4050 boards, have been discontinued and are no
  longer available. As of 01-Dec-2012, new production RCM4000 and
  RCM4050 boards will have a Micron/Numonyx/ST NAND256W3A (32MB)
  nand flash device installed.
  Custom applications which use nand flash, whether based on
  RCM4000, RCM4050 boards or a custom nand flash board design,
  should be recompiled using Dynamic C 10.72 in order to support
  the new, increased selection of small-block nand flash devices.
- The EXCEPTION(x) macro is no longer used in any standard
  Dynamic C code and is now deprecated. Please refer to the
  associated deprecation comments in ERRORS.LIB for more
  information.
- iDigi access via a PPP serial port can now be hosted on an
  alternate parallel port by defining one of IDIGI_PPP_USE_PORTD
  or IDIGI_PPP_USE_PORTE before #use idigi.lib.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.70

NEW FEATURES

- New XBee/ZigBee driver.

  A new XBee/ZigBee driver and standard sample programs are
  provided. See Samples\XBee\ReadMe.txt and the latest version of
  "Dynamic C - An Introduction To ZigBee" for more information.

- MiniCore RCM6600W and RCM6650W support.

  The MiniCore RCM6600W family supports both WiFi (on-core) and
  Ethernet (off-core) network interfaces.

  The MiniCore RCM6600W has a 1 MB serial boot flash while the
  the RCM6650W has a 4MB serial boot flash.  Using the API
  from sflash.lib, on the RCM6650W up to 3MB is available for
  data storage.  See sample programs in Samples\RCM6600W.

- Custom definition of ORG_PLACE_USERDATA_IN_RAMx allows an
  application to relocate the optional user data memory org into
  a specified RAM device.

  To specify the user data memory org's RAM device, add:
     ORG_PLACE_USERDATA_IN_RAMx = RAMx
  into Dynamic C's Project Options' Defines tab, where integer
  RAMx is one of 1, 2, or 3, as appropriate to the application's
  Rabbit board type and compile mode.

  If the user specifies an in-range but non-existent RAMx device
  then a rather cryptic error message will result. For example,
  specifying that the user data buffer should be relocated into
  RAM2 when compiling to an RCM4000 results in the following
  error message: "userdata_buff: This reference has no
  corresponding definition."

  For applications which utilize the optional user data memory
  org, Dynamic C's Project Options' Defines tab is a convenient
  spot to set the required size. For example, adding:
     _SOS_USERDATA = 0x1000
  specifies a 0x1000 byte (4KB) user data memory org.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs

GUI Bugs

Library Bugs
- Defect #34603. DMA functionality in SERLINK.LIB is updated to
  support Rabbit 5000 and 6000 CPUs.
- Defect #37681. TAT11R and TAT12R internal register addresses
  are now conditionally defined in SYSIODEFS.LIB for Rabbit 6000
  CPUs.
- Defect #38379. DMA functionality in RS232.LIB is updated to
  support Rabbit 5000 and 6000 CPUs.
- Defect #38777. When uC/OS-II is used, SERLINK.LIB's ISR now
  prevents task switching while interrupt processing continues
  with reenabled interrupts.
- Defect #39302. In modbus_master.lib, custom _initMBMpacket()
  functionality is restored for TCP-only Modbus master boards. A
  library function stub is now provided, along with function help.
- Defect #39461. In DMAETH100.LIB's internal *._havelink()
  function, errant restart of autonegotiation is prevented when
  autonegotiation is disabled.
- Defect #39750. All memory orgs located in a battery-backable
  SRAM are now properly identified in memory_layout.lib as being
  BB, with regard to both xalloc usage and in the program's MAP
  file. In particular, the RCM6750/60's battery-backable external
  SRAM's memory org is now marked as BB.
- Defect #39751. On RCM56xxW boards, the FAT file system buffers
  have been fixed to the top of the battery-backable RAM org.
  This prevents other BB memory orgs, such as the optional user
  data org, from changing the location of the FAT buffers.
- Defect #40496. In UCOS2.LIB, a number of global variables were
  declared inside a module header, causing data storage
  generation at "#use ucos2.lib" library scan time.
- Defect #41149. The informational error_message() and
  _error_message() functions in errors.lib have been fixed to
  prevent a potential hang problem when an error number is
  specified for which no error message exists.
- Defect #41653. The ROOT_SIZE_4K macro value must be unsigned,
  else values greater than 7 will cause a signed (negative)
  memory org size problem. The check in StdBios.c now enforces
  unsigned ROOT_SIZE_4K values greater than 7.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- Dynamic C's original XBee support libraries (xbee_api.lib, etc.)
  and samples are obsolete and are removed from the Dynamic C
  10.70 release. Users are encouraged to port legacy XBee
  applications to the new XBee/ZigBee driver, however, where
  porting is not practical the application should remain on
  Dynamic C 10.66 or prior version.

- The DMAETH100_AUTO_NEG_TIMEOUT macro is deprecated. Rabbit 5000
  or 6000 built-in Ethernet applications which use a custom
  definition for this macro should instead define one or both of
  the DMAETH100_LINKFAIL_TIMEOUT or DMAETH100_LINKDOWN_TIMEOUT
  macros. The *LINKFAIL* macro value determines the PHY powered-
  up time out for link-failed detection. The *LINKDOWN* macro
  value determines the PHY powered-down idle time-out for no-
  connect Ethernet current reduction. The default value for each
  of the *LINK* macros is 4000 milliseconds, which results in a
  50% powered-up vs. powered-down duty cycle when e.g. Ethernet
  is not connected.

VERSION 10.66

NEW FEATURES

- Addition of the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) restores FAT access
  to NAND flash devices on RCM40xx series modules, or NAND flash added
  to user designs (using Aux I/O bus).  This library also includes
  full wear leveling support across the NAND flash device.

- The stdio window now allows pasting.

- Simple UserBlock File System now available.
  This library (SUBFS.LIB) contains some API functions for managing a
  very small filesystem in the userID block.  It is recommended to
  use SUBFS instead of manually administered, hard-coded offsets into
  the userID block area.  Note that iDigi uses SUBFS to manage its
  configuration data.
  SUBFS is intended to contain small amounts of infrequently changed
  data such as application calibration constants and configuration.
  Up to 15 files may be defined (with names up to 12 characters).
  All operations either succeeed or fail completely, thus the integrity
  of the filesystem is maintained.
  See samples\filesystem\subfs\subfs.c


- RabbitWeb for HTTP has been upgraded to take advantage of new
  libraries introduced for iDigi support.  The following features
  have been added to the ZHTML scripting language:

  1) with(): specify a variable name prefix
     This statement is syntactically like echo().  It takes the
     name (or partial name) of a RabbitWeb variable, and uses that
     name as a prefix for other references to the variable which
     start with '.' or '['.  For example,
       <?z with($foo.bar) ?>
       <?z echo($foo.bar.baz) ?>
       <?z echo($.baz) ?>
     prints the value of the #web variable foo.bar.baz twice.  The first
     echo statement uses the normal (absolute) method of access by
     spelling out the name fully.  The second uses the prefix specified
     by the most recent with() statement.

     On entry to a new brace level, any existing with() prefix is
     propagated into the braces.  A new with() inside the braces will
     change to a new prefix, however when the brace level is closed
     then the original with() prefix (outside the braces) will be
     restored.  Thus, each brace level gets its own with() prefix,
     which is initialized from the current with() prefix of the
     enclosing level.  The initial default (at the outermost level)
     is to have an empty prefix.  Once set, the prefix cannot be
     emptied.  The effect of an empty prefix is obtained simply by
     not using the initial '.' prefix in variable references.

     with() resolves any loop variables when executed.  Thus,
       <?z with($foo[$A].bar) ?>
     sets the prefix to $foo[2].bar (or whatever the value of $A was
     at the time of executing the with() statement).

     The purpose of with() is to save typing and reduce the
     possibility of coding errors.

  2) sizeof(): echo decimal size of a text field
     This is used to avoid hard-coding text field widths and the
     like in HTML input fields.  For example
        <?z sizeof($foo) ?>
     will insert a decimal number in the HTML stream at that point.
     The value of the number depends on the type and size of the
     #web variable 'foo'.  The following table lists the numbers
     generated based on the type:
       int: 6
       unsigned int: 5
       long: 11
       unsigned long: 10
       float: 12
       char[N]: N-1
       other: 0

  3) json(): echo JavaScript Object Notation
     This is used to insert an entire variable tree in the HTML
     stream.  For example, if a #web C variable is defined
     with the following structure:
       struct {
         int a;
         float b;
         struct {
            char s[10];
            int t[5];
         } c;
       } X;
       #web X
     then the following ZHTML markup:
       <?z json($X) ?>
     will insert
       {X:{a:5,b:44,c:{s:"hello",t:[0,1,2,3,4]}}}
     into the HTML stream at that point.  This is a compact
     representation for sending arbitrary data structures in
     a machine-independent manner, and is particularly suitable
     for use with JavaScript.

     Note that the variable specified in the json() statement
     MUST be a root level variable (e.g. you CANNOT use something
     like json($foo.bar)).  Access is only checked for the
     root itself, and inner content is not checked.  Thus, any
     read/write permissions must be specified on the root variable
     and are assumed to apply to the entire contents of the
     structure.

     There is always an outer, "wrapper", object level created in the
     JSON string.  This object has a single member with the name
     of the specified root variable.  A common JavaScript idiom
     is thus to assign the object attribute immediately, using
     something like the following code:
       <SCRIPT>
       x = <?z json($X) ?>.X;
       </SCRIPT>
     which assigns the JavaScript variable 'x' the object X, which
     recapitulates the C variable X on the Rabbit device.

     See samples\tcpip\rabbitweb\thermo_graph.c for demonstration.

- When using userblock API functions, you must now add
  the following LIB to the application program.

  #use "idblock_api.lib"

- When using sfbxxx serial flash API functions, you must now add
  the following LIB to the application program.

  #use "bootdev_sf_api.lib"

- UDP sockets support transmit buffering.  This is enabled by passing
  a negative buffer length to udp_extopen().  In this case, the
  provided buffer is split in half, with the first half used for receive
  and the second half for transmit.  With a normal (positive) buffer
  length parameter, the functionality is unchanged and the entire buffer
  is used for receive buffering.  Prior to this change, udp_sendto()
  always tried to push the datagram to the driver.  This could fail in
  two common cases: (1) The hardware address of the destination was not
  yet resolved (via ARP) or (2) the network driver did not have
  sufficient buffering to accept the next packet.  With the new behavior,
  udp_sendto() will attempt to send the datagram immediately if possible,
  otherwise it will buffer the datagram for later automatic transmission.

  Other networking libraries which use UDP, such as SNMP.LIB, have been
  modified to take advantage of the transmit buffer.

  In general, it is recommended to use a transmit buffer in any of the
  following cases:
  . RAM usage is not critical; there is spare RAM for the buffer
  . The UDP protocol does not include any acknowledgment/retransmit
    protocol
  . Very large datagrams are transmitted (such as would require
    outgoing fragmentation)
  . The additional code complexity of checking for ARP resolution before
    each udp_sendto() is not desired.

  Note that this change is not intended to make UDP "reliable", however
  it should improve the performance of UDP applications by removing most
  causes of datagram "infant mortality".

- LZ compression library now supports I/O streams for input to and output
  from compression/decompression functions.  This allows use of FAT files.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #21843. Label scoping has been corrected and the compiler
  now disallows goto targets outside the current function and warns
  if branch instruction targets are not labels.
- Defect #23181. The final entry in an xstring declaration can now be
  followed by a comma for easier macro formatting.
- Defect #25265: The maximum length for a unique symbol name is now 63,
  doubled from the ANSI C89 minimum of 31.
- Defect #25589. Casts to array type are not allowed and now generate
  the appropriate errors.
- Defect #25911. Casts to array type are not allowed and now generate
  the appropriate errors.
- Defect #26670. Using far with array typedefs in declarations could
  cause internal stack imbalance errors.
- Defect #27885: Non-prototyped assembly labels called from C now warn
  If a label is defined in an asm statement or #asm block, and the label
  is called as a C function, the label should be given a C prototype.
  If an unprototyped label is assigned to a function pointer, a warning
  will also be issued that the return type of the label does not match
  that of the function pointer.
- Defect #30627. Assigning the return value of a function returning
  structure type to a structure in far was broken if the destination
  (left-hand-side of the assignment) was a complex expression, such
  as a structure pointer dereference.
- Defect #32597: Strings are concatenated across lines
  ANSI C requires adjacent character strings to be concatenated.
  Previously, if the strings were on separate lines, the newline had to
  be escaped with a backslash.  This restriction has been removed.
- Defect #32723. The IDE will now ask to save .C and .H files that
  are modified in editor windows before proceeding with a compile.
- Defect #33006. Garbage following #ifdef, #ifndef, and #elif was
  incorrectly ignored.

  (i.e. sizeof("string")) are no longer emitted to the target as data.
- Defect #33382: !(-0.0) now evaluates to true.
- Defect #33579. Passing a const array to a function taking a non-const
  void pointer did not warn even though the const is discarded.
- Defect #33880. Removed constant-index array bounds checking as per
  the ANSI C spec.

      (void) 0;
      (void) function_returning_int();
- Defect #34174. Structures (not pointers) can now be used as
  operands in ternary operators.
- Defect #34323: function pointer returning char as condition generates
  incorrect code.
- Defect #34939. The compiler would not parse a function name in
  parentheses, which was needed for ANSI masking macros.
- Defect #35077, 33618: newline after open paren caused the beginning of
  the next line to be ignored.

GUI Bugs

Library Bugs
- Defect #28280. Corrected the spectrum spreader setting value,
  when enabled, for Rabbit 4000+ boards with non-doubled main
  clock where the main clock is less than 50 MHz.
- Defect #28355. Adding watches on string literals in a program
  with separate I&D space disabled no longer overwrites root
  constants or code.
- Defect #28609. Watch expressions on variables while single-
  stepping inside a cofunction now works correctly.
- Defect #29079. The compiler defined _CRYSTAL_SPEED_ macro value
  is now exact for boards with 20 MHz or 25 MHz main oscillators.
- Defect #34017. ZSERVER.LIB's sspec_changefv() no longer NUL-
  terminates maximum length string type form variables at one
  less than the maximum specified length.
- Defect #33401. The strtod function now sets errno = ERANGE and
  returns (with appropriate sign) one of HUGE_VAL or 0 when
  overflow or underflow is detected.
- Defect #34292. ASIX.LIB functionality now conforms to the
  "BUFFER RING OVERFLOW" recovery method as described in the
  AX88796 L data sheet.
- Defect #34414.  Comments, CDATA and PIs now supported (and ignored) in XML.
- Defect #34508.  <reboot> element in query descriptor does not cause reboot.
- Defect #34530.  Empty element content in a set command now sets string
  variable to empty rather than leaving the value unchanged.
- Defect #34449. Fixed a CoData structure corruption error in
  RS232.LIB's internal indexed cofunction which underlies the
  cof_serXputs and cof_serXwrite cofunction macros.
- Defect #34549. The default value of the _SYS_MALLOC_BLOCKS
  macro is reduced on Rabbit boards whose primary RAM size is <=
  128 KBytes, e.g. RCM5700/10. Note that applications which use
  malloc may define custom values for the _SYS_MALLOC_BLOCKS and
  _APP_MALLOC_BLOCKS macros, within the limits of the
  application-specific available memory.
- Defect #34699. STDIO_FAT.c's fopen() with 'w' access mode
  doesn't truncate file to zero length.

  returning EOF.
- Defect #35113: getenv() now returns "char *" instead of "char far *".
- Defect #37026. Fixed a Samples\FileSystem\FAT\fat_ucos.c run
  time crash when fat_AutoMount() is called before OSStart().
- Defect #37713. "strcspn() result is always 0 when its brk (i.e. 2nd)
  parameter is an empty string."
- getswf() and getsn() flush every character to stdout (which is now buffered).
- Added crc16.lib for shared use by serlink.lib, sdflash.lib and idblock.lib;
  deprecate getcrc() and getfarcrc() in favor of crc16_calc().
- Fixed incorrect return type of _f_memset.
- Fixed incorrect macro definitions for 5 of 13 functions when
  USE_FAR_STRING_LIB is defined.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- To provide improved application stability and lower EMI/RFI
  noise, the MiniCore RCM67xx family's recommended, default PLL
  output frequency is now 325 MHz (162.5 MHz Rabbit clock).

- iDigi now supports writable (from the iDigi app) keepalive timers and
  counters.

- HTTP library has been upgraded to use less root memory.  The following
  incompatibilities may need to be fixed at the application level:
  . HTTP_CUSTOM_HEADERS: if this macro is used in order to manage
    custom HTTP headers, note that the function parameters are changed
    to use far pointers.
  . http_getData() and http_getURL(): these API functions changed to
    return far data.  Should not cause too many changes in applications
    since most API functions like sprintf() will transparently accept
    far pointers.  Some functions like memcpy() and strcpy() may need
    to be changed to use the far versions of these functions (_f_memcpy()
    and _f_strcpy()).

- New RabbitWeb compatibility issues
  The new RabbitWeb library has a different underlying implementation
  than the previous version, and there are a few differences that
  may prevent direct recompilation of existing RabbitWeb code.
  If required, you can continue to use the old RabbitWeb library
  by #define USE_LEGACY_RABBITWEB at the top of your C code.  This
  will bring in the old library, however it is not guaranteed that
  the old RabbitWeb library will work with iDigi.  If using iDigi,
  then it is recommended to upgrade any RabbitWeb (HTTP) code
  to use the new RabbitWeb libraries.

  It is expected that free maintenance will no longer be available
  for the old RabbitWeb library, thus customers should upgrade to
  the new library within the next few releases of Dynamic C,
  particularly if intending to use iDigi.

  The following items are different between RabbitWeb versions:

  1) Root of data structures must be #web'd
  The old RabbitWeb allows
    #web foo.bar
  without necessarily requiring
    #web foo
  The new RabbitWeb requires the root name of any #web variables
  to be registered using #web.  This introduces the following
  potential problems:
    a) If only a few members of a large structure were registered,
       registering the root will now require more memory.
  	 b) Structure and array members that were inaccessible now
  	    become accessible to web browser users.
  Workarounds:
    a) Split out the desired members into their own smaller
       structure.
    b) Explicitly add access protection to the structure and
       array elements that were "exposed".

  Note: when registering variables which are arrays at the root
  level, use
    #web foo[@]
  not just
    #web foo

  2) Arrays are now homogeneous
  The old RabbitWeb allowed individual array elements to be
  #web'd with different attributes (guard and update expressions,
  group permissions etc.).  The new RabbitWeb enforces uniform
  attributes for all elements in an array.  This considerably
  speeds up access and reduces memory requirements.  Any existing
  application which takes advantage of this may need to be re-
  factored to make all elements have the same behavior.  If there
  are different guard requirements for different array elements,
  then this can be achieved by creative use of auxiliary arrays
  which hold different information for the corresponding elements
  in the original array.  See samples\tcpip\rabbitweb\arrays.c
  for a demonstration.

  Another style of work-around can be used in more complex cases.
  For example, old style:

	   typedef struct {
	      int baud;
	      int stopbits;
	   } SerPort;

	   SerPort ports[3];
	   #web ports[@]
	   #web ports[2] (...unique to port 2...)

  becomes:

	   typedef struct {
	      int baud;
	      int stopbits;
	   } SerPort;

	   struct {
	      SerPort port0, port1, port2;
	   } _ports;
	   #web _ports
	   #web _ports.port2 (...unique to port 2...)
	   SerPort * ports = &_ports.port0;

  This does require some changes to ZHTML files, because the names
  of the variables are necessarily changed.  The last statement
  above initializes a pointer to simulate the original array style,
  thus a lot of the application code can remain unchanged.

  It is realatively easy to identify application code where this
  incompatibility will cause problems: simply look for #web statement
  which specify explicit numeric array indices (rather than the '@'
  placeholder).  Such constructs identify non-homogenous array metadata.


  3) char fields are now numbers, not ASCII characters
  For compatibility with iDigi, variables declared as single
  C characters are now considered to be unsigned numbers from
  0 to 255.  The old RabbitWeb treated these as single character
  strings.  The workaround for this is to change the web variable
  definition from 'char x' to 'char x[2]', i.e. a single char
  string plus null terminator.  This may necessitate some code
  changes (e.g. prefixing some expressions with '*' in order to
  dereference to the first character of the string).  All such
  places will be picked up by the compiler's type checking.

  4) [n] suffix on @ placeholders now ignored
  Multidimensional array placeholders used to require constructs
  of the following form:
    $arry[@[0]][@[1]]
  The new library ignores the index suffix, and thus the above
  construct should be simplified to
    $arry[@][@]
  The only place where this would cause a problem is if code
  had deliberately swapped the array indices from the usual
  order, for example to transpose the elements of a matrix.
  There is no simple workaround other than to rework the
  relevant piece of code.  This change is considered extremely
  unlikely to affect any customers.

- Longer symbol names supported
  Previous versions of Dynamic C used the first 31 characters in a
  symbol to define a unique symbol, the minimum required by the ANSI C89
  specification.  As of 10.66, the first 63 characters are used.

  Note: the compiler preprocesses library files into MD1 files to
  determine the locations of header (the line after a BeginHeader
  statement) and module (after the EndHeader statement) blocks, and
  their associated labels (the list of symbols within the BeginHeader
  statement).  If a module label is more than 31 characters, the MD1
  file will not be correct, and the module will not be found.  Modifying
  and saving the file will force the compiler to regenerate the MD1
  file.  For example, open the library in Dynamic C, add a space and
  delete it, then save the library.

- Introduced compiler improvements to generate shorter code sequences for
  many instances.  Compiler should generate smaller binary files than in
  previous releases.

- The User now has more flexible control of serial character assembly
  during RS-232 line break condition on any or all of serial ports A
  through F. When defined by the User, the previously supported
  RS232_NOCHARASSYINBRK macro disables character assembly during line
  breaks for all serial ports. When RS232_NOCHARASSYINBRK is not defined
  but one or more of the newly supported RS232_A_NOCHARASSYINBRK through
  RS232_F_NOCHARASSYINBRK macros are defined by the User, then character
  assembly during line break is disabled for only the associated serial
  port(s).

- Sample program samples\tcpip\NIST_TIME.C has been removed as of this
  release.  The protocol used, TCP time, is obsolete and may not work
  reliably or accurately with public time servers.  See SNTP_TIME.C for
  improved protocol which is more accurate and reliable, and is widely
  supported by public time servers.

- Secure HTTP samples (in samples\tcpip\SSL\HTTPS) have been modified
  to use PEM format certificates instead of DCC format.  DCC format
  is deprecated as of this release, since (for RSA) it is about 3-4
  times slower at run-time than PEM format.  The Dynamic C Certificate
  Utility already produces the appropriate .pem files.  The .dcc file
  need not be generated or used.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.64

NEW FEATURES
- Added support for ANSI-C file scoping. Each C file in a project
  now has its own scope independent of the other C files in the
  project. #use still works but the interaction with the new file
  scoping is different. See the Dynamic C User's Manual for more
  information.

- Added support for ANSI-C block (nested) scoping. As per the
  specification, every curly-brace-delimited block now defines a
  new scope that is a child of the function or block in which
  the block occurs. Note that this also allows the declaration of
  variables at the beginning of any block.

- Added ANSI C89/ISO C90 compliant support for 'const'. Dynamic C
  now handles the 'const' modifier in a manner consistent with
  the ANSI/ISO specification, unlike previous versions that
  limited the use of 'const' to initialized variables. See the
  Dynamic C User's Manual for more information.

- Added support for 'signed char' type and use of 'signed' to
  describe 'int' and 'long int' types.

- Updated libraries for compliance with ANSI C89/ISO C90 Standard.
  Define the macro __ANSI_STRICT__ to get ANSI behavior instead
  of legacy Dynamic C behavior.

  Notable additions and changes include:

  stdarg.h: Standard macros for accessing variable arguments.

  stdio.h: Includes full support of streams (FILE *) via standard
           functions like fopen(), fread(), fwrite(), etc.

           Includes scanf functions (fscanf, sscanf, vfscanf,
           etc.) with support for most of C99 format specifiers.

           Includes formatted print functions (printf, fprintf,
           snprintf, vfprintf, etc.) with support for most of
           C99 format specifiers.

           If __ANSI_PRINTF__ is defined, field widths in *printf
           functions grow to display full value (instead of
           displaying "***" to indicate overflow).

           If __ANSI_PUTS__ is defined, puts() appends a newline
           to the string sent to STDOUT (instead of just sending
           the string).

  stdlib.h: Adds atexit() to register functions that will auto-
            matically run when a program exits.

            Adds _n_bsearch() and _f_bsearch() for performing
            binary searches on sorted lists.

            Limited recursion in _n_qsort() and _f_qsort() to
            improve performance and eliminate possible stack
            overflow when sorting a large sorted list.

            Adds div() and ldiv() for getting quotient and
            remainder with a single division call.

  time.h: Includes strftime(), ctime() and asctime() for
          formatted time printing.

          If __ANSI_TIME__ is defined, uses ANSI-compliant
          'struct tm' structure.

- MiniCore RCM6700, RCM6710, RCM6750 and RCM6760 support added.
  The MiniCore RCM6700/10s have a 1 MB serial boot flash while
  the RCM6750/60s have a 4MB serial boot flash.  Using the API
  from sflash.lib, on the RCM6750/60 up to 3MB are available for
  data storage.  See sample programs in Samples\RCM6700.

- iDigi library support added.  iDigi allows devices to be managed
  remotely using web services and/or a web browser.  See
  http://www.idigi.com.

  Support for iDigi in a Rabbit/Dynamic C environment is available
  by #use "idigi.lib".  Sample programs are in samples\idigi.

  iDigi on the Rabbit provides the following features:

  . Robust remote network configuration, even when devices are
    deployed behind firewalls
  . Integration of Digi ADDP (Advanced Device Discovery Protocol)
  . Security via TLS/SSL.
  . Registration of custom commands for access by web services
    via the SCI (Server Command Interface)
  . Ability to upload data to the iDigi server using http (or
    https) PUT requests
  . Remote firmware update.

  iDigi runs on any Rabbit module or SBC with a Rabbit 4000 or more
  recent procesor, and an Ethernet and/or WiFi network interface.
  Use of TLS/SSL also requires at least 256k RAM.  PPP is not
  yet supported.

  Storage of network configurations in non-volatile storage requires
  a recommended 8kB space in the Rabbit userID block.  This storage
  includes a backup network configuration.  The backup configuration
  is tried if the desired configuration fails to achieve a connection
  to the iDigi server within a specified timeout.  This will eliminate
  the need for on-site access in order to fix any misconfigurations.

  The network configurations are also stored in a manner which is
  insensitive to firmware upgrades that maintain iDigi support.  This
  will eliminate any necessity to provide special upgrade or data
  conversion routines for network configurations.

- Defect #22592. Constant comparison of floating point 0.0 to
  itself (equality/inequality) was incorrect.
- Defect #24547. List file constant data addresses were not
  incrementing properly.
- Defect #28149. Rabbit 4000 registers were not checked against
  macro names to avoid naming conflicts.
- Defect #32085. When opening editor windows, file paths were
  not normalized so it was possible to have multiple windows
  of the same file open and not have them synchronized.
- Defect #32741. Compiler sometimes did not sychronize multiple
  open editor windows of the same file when saving the file.
- Defect #33005. BIOS map file indicated that the BIOS root data
  usage was zero when there was actually root data being used.
- Defect #33722. Two empty switch statements back-to-back would
  generate strange errors.
- Defect #33736. A local assembly label could override a global
  label in a different #asm block in certain circumstances.
- Defect #33878. Map file call graph has been fixed.
- Defect #33885. __FUNCTION__ macro no longer appears in map
  files.
- Defect #33886. Now accepts "F" or "f" suffix on floating point
  values.
- Defect #34024. Equivalent recursive structures defined in
  different scopes but used together could cause compiler
  crashes.

GUI Bugs

Library Bugs
- Defect #24080. SERLINK.LIB's ppplink_asymap() function now
  respects the peer's asynchronous serial escape character
  table setting.
- Defect #27171. When redirecting STDIO to a serial port, CR is
  now sent before (instead of after) LF.
- Defect #31637. RabbitWeb did not properly handle structs
  containing arrays of structs.
- Defect #33060. RCM56xxW boards now permit limited FAT file
  system usage of the serial program flash.
- Defect #33100. STRING.LIB's _f_strncmp() function is fixed.
- Defect #33123. The BL4S1xx.lib's and BLxS2xx.LIB's setExtInterrupt
  functions' help descriptions now clearly state that the RIO
  supports a maximum of two external interrupt channels per block.
- Defect #33266. Battery-backable RAM (BBRAM) is correctly reported
  as such in all compile modes for all Rabbit boards equipped with
  BBRAM.
- Defect #33285. The fix for defect #28999 (failure in RabbitWeb
  select) was accidentally reverted in 10.54 release.  Re-committed
  fix for this release.
- Defect #33443. SERLINK.LIB's serial ISRs now preserve all Rabbit
  4000+ registers.
- Defect #33718. Dynamic C 10.62 was configuring PD2 as an output
  before calling main.  Now left as power-on default of input.
- Defect #33797. PPP serial port E initialization in SERLINK.LIB no
  longer disrupts serial port A (programming port) when
  IFS_PPP_USEPORTD or IFS_PPP_USEPORTE is configured.
- Defect #33853. All serial ports' initialization in SERLINK.LIB now
  reads SxDR four times, which suffices to clear any possible
  pending data in any serial port.
- HTTP client no longer returns -ENOTCONN at end of body when
  server doesn't send a Content-Length header.
- 0.0 is now considered equal to -0.0.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- Serial library now includes serXsending() function to check
  transmit status of serial port.  Returns non-zero if bytes are
  buffered or in CPU's serial shift register.

- Functions rand() and srand() were renamed to randf() and
  srandf() to allow for C90-compliant versions (which return
  an integer instead of a float).

- Updated samples/xmem/xstring.c demonstrates efficient method
  for using xstrings directly, instead of copying to root buffer.

DEPRECATED FEATURES

- Macro STDIO_ENABLE_LONG_STRINGS is deprecated.  printf() is no
  longer restricted to 127 characters.

- The near/far-prefixed versions (e.g., _f_strlen and _n_strlen)
  of some functions have been deprecated and the non-prefixed
  name (e.g., strlen) should be used instead.  Functions:
  atof, atoi, atol, memcmp, strcmp, strncmp, strcspn, strspn,
  strcmpi, strncmpi, strlen.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.62

NEW FEATURES
- TLS/SSL security is now available for use with any TCP/IP socket,
  as a general facility, via the new sock_secure() and sock_unsecure()
  API functions.  Previously, TLS was only available as an internal
  component when using the HTTP server library, or as part of WiFi
  authentication.  It is now available for general use, in client
  or server roles as applicable.  HTTP, SMTP and POP3 are all
  TLS-capable, with minor modifications to existing applications.

  Once a socket is secured, the same set of API functions that are used
  for ordinary TCP sockets may be used with the secure socket.  This
  makes it very easy to convert an existing TCP socket application to
  use SSL/TLS for enhanced security.

  The TLS/SSL API is compatible with products that have more than 128k
  of RAM and a Rabbit 4000 or newer CPU.

- TCP/IP client libraries HTTP_CLIENT.LIB, SMTP.LIB and POP3.LIB now
  support TLS encryption.  HTTP client supports the "https://"
  scheme.  SMTP allows use of the STARTTLS command (RFC 3207), and
  POP3 allows use of POP3 tunneled via a TLS connection.  New
  sample programs demonstrate the TLS features of these libraries.
  See:
     samples\tcpip\http\https_client.c
     samples\tcpip\http\https_client_nb.c
     samples\tcpip\pop3\pop_tls.c
     samples\tcpip\smtp\smtp_tls.c

- Function pointer prototypes with parameters are now allowed
  and type-checked in Dynamic C.

- Addition of __FUNCTION__ macro, which is defined to a string
  literal containing the name of the surrounding function (it
  is not defined outside of functions).

- HTTP_CLIENT.LIB now supports redirection (3xx response codes from
  HTTP servers may be handled transparently to the application), plus
  non-blocking open and close of HTTP client connections are now
  supported.

- Serial library (RS232.LIB) now supports far buffers for reading
  and writing data.  You need to update your code if you use
  function pointers to call serXread, serXputs, serXwrite,
  cof_serXgets, cof_serXread, cof_serXputs, cof_serXwrite or the
  equivalent functions with X replaced by A-F.  Update your
  function pointer prototypes to include parameters, or upcast
  pointer parameters to far in the function pointer calls.

  Example:
	      char buffer[32];			// buffer in root or on stack
	      int (*ser_read1)();
	      int (*ser_read2( void far *, int, unsigned long);
			int (*ser_puts1)();
			int (*ser_puts2)( void far *);

	      serDread( buffer, 32, 0);						// OK

	      ser_read1 = serDread;
	      ser_read1( buffer, 32, 0);						// BAD
	      ser_read1( (char far *) buffer, 32, 0);	// OK

	      ser_read2 = serDread;
	      ser_read2( buffer, 32, 0);						// OK

			ser_puts1 = serDputs;
			ser_puts1( "Test");								// BAD
			ser_puts1( (char far *) "Test");				// OK

			ser_puts2 = serDputs;
			ser_puts2( "Test");								// OK

- Added power-fail safe option to Remote Program Update on boards
  that boot from serial flash.  Define BU_ENABLE_SECONDARY in
  the project defines to enable the feature.  View Samples\
  RemoteProgramUpdate\download_firmware.c for an example of how
  it is used.

- Some functions from Remote Program Update API are now available
  on all boards (e.g., buOpenFirmwareBoot, buOpenFirmwareRunning,
  buVerifyFirmware).

  See Samples\RemoteProgramUpdate\verify_firmware.c for examples
  on how to use the API to check for corruption of boot firmware
  or firmware running in RAM.

- Added Samples\tcpip\http\Twitter.c to demonstrate use of http
  client library to post status updates to Twitter.

- RS232.LIB adds ser[A-F]txBreak functions for generating character
  (or longer) breaks by holding the transmit pin low.

- RS232.LIB adds serXfastwrite for partial writes to the serial
  transmit buffer.  serXwrite continues to block until all bytes
  have been copied to the buffer.

- serXparity can configure a port for 1 or 2 stop bits, in addition
  to even/odd/mark/space/no parity bit.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #21410. Modifier "xmem" on a variable was ignored
  without warning.
- Defect #21586. Stack imbalance was generated when directly
  returning the return value of a function returning struct.
- Defect #21715. Certain pragmas would cause incorrect syntax
  errors in #asm blocks.
- Defect #21794. Comments were not handled correctly in some
  statements where a '\\' character occured, resulting in
  strange syntax errors.
- Defect #21821. Dynamic C did not catch missing commas between
  initializer blocks (sub-initializers) in the initializer lists
  for arrays and structs.
- Defect #32282. Map file root data info did not match the org
  file in some cases.

GUI Bugs
- Defect #32027. GUI did not allow compilation of default source
  file (Compiler Options->Advanced) if no editor window was open.
- Fixed Help Menu bugs related to having spaces in the Dynamic C
  pathname.  I/O Registers item now works correctly on systems
  where the default web browser isn't Internet Explorer.

Debugger Bugs
- Defect #21625. Run-time exceptions did not always show the
  correct line and file information.  Run-time exceptions now
  display the file, function, and line information when available,
  and the address of the exception otherwise.
- Debug evaluation of expressions containing string literals now
  gives correct results.

Library Bugs
- Defect #20900. In certain cases, the UDP library wasn't releasing
  a bad ARP table handle.
- Defect #21640. Stack(s) are now allocated more space-
  efficiently, using _xalloc's alignment capability. Also, the
  correct value is assigned to the global BaseOfStacks1 variable.
- Defect #21940. In RabbitWeb, a POST without variables could result
  in a "403 Forbidden" server response.
- Defect #26368. DMA.LIB's mem2ioe, mem2ioi, ioe2mem and ioi2mem
  functions now set up the I/O DMA source or destination flags
  correctly.
- Defect #31459. The sprintf/printf ragged left justification
  plus associated possible buffer overflow can no longer occur.
- Defect #32272. Fixed bug in SNMP library introduced in 10.54.
- Defect #32281. FTP_CLIENT.LIB is updated to work with the IIS
  FTP server by discarding any extra arguments in the response
  to Rabbit's QUIT.
- Defect #32426. Packet receive is no longer attempted on
  powered-down polled network interfaces. In particular, WiFi
  boards' powerdown.c samples now work as expected when
  IFC_WIFI_WPA_PSK_HEXSTR is appropriately defined.
- Defect #32434. SDFLASH.LIB's sdspi_get_csd() function now
  supports SD cards whose CSD block uses CRC7 instead of CRC16.
- Defect #32470. Serial data flash sizes in SFLASH.LIB's
  sf_devtable[] information array now reflect the full number of
  pages on each of the supported devices.
- Defect #31863. Updated TextBorderInit() to accept either NULL
  or an empty string for no title.
- Defect #30862. Updated documentation in tcp_config.lib for the
  case where an access point is set to TKIP OR CCMP.
- Defect #32032. Fixed error "Internal error Assertion "false"
  failed in file COMPCORE\CC_IA.CPP, line 627"

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- Serial library ISRs (interrupt service routines) updated for
  increased reliability and better performance.  Rabbit processor
  should handle higher baud rates and use less CPU time to manage
  serial data.

- RS232.LIB now uses more efficient thresholds for controlling the
  RTS pin when using hardware flow control.

- Calling serXread with a timeout of 0ms no longer copies bytes
  received during the function call (a problem at higher baud rates).

- STDIO.LIB adds getsn(), a length-limited version of gets().
  Updated getswf() keeps the user's input null-terminated so caller
  can re-print it if necessary.

- buDownloadTick (board_update.lib) now returns error -ENODATA on
  0-byte download.

- ifconfig(...IFS_NAMESERVER_ADD...) allows zero nameserver address,
  which is ignored.

- HTTPS server improved tear-down code to eliminate possible delays
  at the client (browser) sode.

- Added gethostid_iface() function to return local IP address of
  specified interface (instead of just the default interface).

- Added ability to dynamically allocate TCP socket buffers using
  _sys_malloc().  This feature is enabled by calling tcp_extopen()
  or tcp_extlisten() with a NULL buffer parameter, but a non-zero
  buffer length parameter.  The buffers are freed when the socket
  is closed.  See the function descriptions for details.

- URL.LIB now supports all far strings.

DEPRECATED FEATURES

- Some macros and functions have been removed from the TCP/IP
  libraries.  The following macros have been removed, but may be
  added back if [#define _DC10_LEGACY] is placed before [#use
  "dcrtcp.lib"]:
	#define MAXINT 0x7fff   // Use stdc INT_MAX instead
	// Use functions (i_min, i_max, u_min, u_max,
	//                long_min, long_max, ulong_min, ulong_max)
	// Functions are as good or faster than macros in this case.
	#define min(X,Y) (((X)<=(Y))?(X):(Y))
	#define max(X,Y) (((X)>=(Y))?(X):(Y))
	// Use memcpy()
	#define movmem(X,Y,Z) memcpy((Y),(X),(Z))
	#define FP_OFF(X) ((unsigned int)X)
	// These already defined
	#define TRUE            1
	#define true            TRUE
	#define FALSE           0
	#define false           FALSE

	// These have been deprecated a long time
	#define my_ip_addr   _if_tab[IF_DEFAULT].ipaddr
	#define sin_mask     _if_tab[IF_DEFAULT].mask
	#define _mtu         _if_tab[IF_DEFAULT].mtu
	#define multihomes 0    // never did this (can use virtual ethernets)

- Following functions and macros removed.  These have been deprecated
  for a long time, and have replacements as noted.
   tcp_config()  // function removed, see ifconfig()
   rip()         // no replacement.
	_add_server() // function removed, see servlist.lib.
	sethostid()   // Use ifconfig().

- Following undocumented functions and macros removed:
   tcp_checkfor, tcp_shutdown, tcp_set_ports, tcp_get_ports,
   sock_sselect, sock_debugdump, debugpsocketlen, sem_up,
   sock_stats, sock_stats_reset, tcp_set_debug_state
	Following were visible for sock_sselect routine return values:
	#define SOCKESTABLISHED 1
	#define SOCKDATAREADY   2
	#define SOCKCLOSED      4
	A number of macros and function related to IP fragmentation
	support were removed, since these were non-functional.
   _cookie, _last_cookie  - unused variables.


*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.60

NEW FEATURES

- #include. In addition to Dynamic C's #use (which is designed to
  work with specially formatted source files), Dynamic C 10.60
  introduces the standard C #include, which follows the ANSI
  C 1989/ISO C 1990 specification.

- Multiple C file projects. The new Project Explorer Window allows
  for the creation of projects utilizing multiple C files, and
  several menu options have been added to allow compilation of
  the current project.

- Variable initializer support

  Variables can now be initialized when they are declared.  For
  example,

   void foo(int bar) {
      int i = 0, j = bar * 2;
      struct FOO {float pi, e, sqrt2;} fvals =
                        {3.14159, 2.71828, 1.41421};
      static far char carray[] = "String literal initializer";
         ...
   }

  Variable initialization follows the ANSI C 1989/ISO C 1990
  specification:
  - Simple variables (numeric types and pointers) can be initialized
    with any expression that evaluates to the correct type.
  - Initializers for aggregate types (structs, arrays, unions) may
    only contain constants that are known at compile time.
  - Initializers for auto (non-static local) variables are evaluated
    at each function entry.
  - Initializers for static and global variables are evaluated once
    at boot (much like Dynamic C's #GLOBAL_INIT statements).

- Preprocessor support for "defined" keyword

  The "defined" keyword can be used in #if/#elif expressions to
  determine whether a macro is already defined.  If MACRO is
  defined, "defined MACRO" evaluates to 1, otherwise it evaluates
  to 0.  The macro can be optionally surrounded by parentheses for
  clarity.

- Added library, sample and Windows utilities demonstrating ADDP
  (Advanced Device Discovery Protocol), a UDP multicast protocol
  used for discoverying and configuring devices on a LAN.  Look
  at Samples/tcpip/addp.c for sample Rabbit code using the ADDP
  server library, and the folder Utilities/ADDP for programs and
  a DLL for running an ADDP client under Windows.

- Added support for automatic selection of a link-local IP
  address (169.254.1.0 to 169.254.254.255) as a fallback when
  DHCP is not available, or for zero-configuration static IP
  networks.  Inclue [#define USE_LINKLOCAL] in your program
  before [#use "dcrtcp.lib"], and then use any 169.254.x.x address
  for a static IP or DHCP fallback IP.  The Rabbit will
  automatically select an available, valid address as outlined in
  RFC 3927.

- MiniCore RCM5650W support added. The MiniCore RCM5650W uses a
  4MB serial boot flash in place of the 1MB flash used on the
  RCM5600W.  Using the API from sflash.lib, 3MB are available
  for data storage.  See sample programs in Samples\RCM5600W.

- Several new commands are available on the File menu.  In addition
  to the "Open..." command, separate "Open Source File..." and
  "Open Library..." commands are available to specifically open
  .c and .lib files respectively.  Also, a recently used list
  of projects is now available under File | Project.  Choosing
  a project from the list will cause the current project to
  close and the selected project to open.

- The default width and height for new editor windows can now be
  set on the Display tab of the Environment Options dialog box.

- "Time Stamp Each Run" is a new checkbox that helps to clearly
  identify different runs in logged stdio output by placing a
  timestamp between each run in the log file.  This checkbox
  is in the stdio options on the Debug Windows tab of the
  Environment Options dialog.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #27144. Bounds checking now allows access to the null-terminator
  of a string literal using direct array indexing.
- Defect #30578. Constant arithmetic operations on characters now result
  in an expression of integral type.
- Defect #30588. When indexing a string literal directly, array bounds
  checking had an off-by-one error according to the ANSI C spec treatment
  of string literals.
- Defect #31381. Sizeof incorrectly returned the size of a pointer
  when string literal optimization was on. Sizeof now correctly returns
  the size of the string literal in this case.
- Defect #31446, #31076: Far pointer in near const array gets wrong
  value.  Pointers in arrays were being initialized according to the
  storage of the array, not the storage of the dereferenced object.
  Pointer values now correctly correspond to the dereferenced object.
- Defect #31227, #31189: Const far static local variable in watch
  expression is wrong, or breaks watch expressions.  Local far and
  const variables are now evaluated correctly in watch expressions,
  flyovers, and the expression evaluation dialog.
- Defect #25812: Compile time array bounds checking is wrong.
  Compile time array bounds checking now issues a warning instead of
  an error, and checks both lower and upper bound.
- Defect #21373: Correct problems with \u in string literals and
  escaped characters in assembly character literals.

Library Bugs
- TCP/IP stack no longer classifies ARP packets with a source address
  of 0.0.0.0 as an IP conflict.
- Defect #29565: LIMITS.H incorrectly defined INT_MIN and SHRT_MIN
  as -32,767 and LONG_MIN as -2,147,483,647.  All three macros are
  now correctly defined as the most-negative value that can be
  represented by each data type.  INT_MIN and SHRT_MIN (16-bit
  integer) evaluate to -32,768 and LONG_MIN (32-bit integer)
  evaluates to -2,147,483,648.  This corrects a bug in RabbitWeb
  and ZServer where it was impossible to set an integer to -32,768
  or a long to -2,147,483,648.
- Defect #31404: Fixed memory leak when using RabbitWeb and calling
  http_shutdown(0) and then http_init() to take HTTP server down and up.
- Defect #31442 fixed. After bringing down a PPP interface, all
  far buffer pointers are now correctly freed to prevent buffer
  allocation problems when bringing the PPP interface back up.
- Defect #31780 fixed.  Multicast UDP sockets will continue to
  receive packets after an interface goes down and comes back up.

Gui Bugs
- Defect #25072: Dynamic C will not compile or return to debug
  mode (Shift+F5) if a read-only library file used in the program
  is opened, modified and not saved while in debug mode.
- Defect #27207: The editor now treats the double quote and
  backslash characters as delimiters.  Double clicking on a
  word surrounded by double quotes will no longer include
  the quotes in the selection.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- Added to ASIX.LIB and extended in DMAETH100.LIB support for the
  PD_NETWORK_MODE ioctl, which is now updated to accept -1 "Don't
  change . . . setting" values for each of its Ethernet speed and
  duplex setting parameters. See the pd_networkmode() online
  function help for details.
- Applications can now specify additional data to append to ICMP
  echo request packets ("ping").  See the documentation for
  _send_ping_iface() for details.

DEPRECATED FEATURES
- Cloning is not supported on the RCM5750, RCM5760, and RCM5650W,
  and is deprecated on all other Rabbit 4000 and Rabbit 5000 based
  products.  The Rabbit Field Utility (RFU) has been enhanced to
  handle loading firmware onto many devices at once.  Please use
  RFU.exe located in the utilities directory instead of cloning.


*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.56

NEW FEATURES

- MiniCore RCM5750/RCM5760 support added. The MiniCore RCM5750
  and RCM5760 add an additional 512k fast SRAM and a 2 MB serial
  flash to the RCM5700 and RCM5710 respectively.

- The Rabbit Embedded Security Pack is now included with Dynamic C,
  adding enterprise level Wi-Fi authentication, SSL, and AES to
  the Dynamic C standard set of libraries.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs

Library Bugs
- Defect #30649: ModemFWLoad.c now works with Separate I&D
  enabled on an RCM4510W.
- Defect #30694: xbee_init can still initialize an XBee with
  multiple buffered frames waiting at startup.
- Defect #30725: xbee_api.lib is now using correct maximum
  payload size of 84 bytes (instead of 80) with ZigBee firmware.
- Defect #30799: Fixed compile errors in httpc_post-related
  functions of http_client.lib.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.54

NEW FEATURES

- Remote Program Update library and samples added, used to update
  boot firmware without having physical access to the hardware.
  Supported on the RCM4200, RCM4300-series, RCM4400W-series,
  RCM5400W-series, RCM5600W, BL4S100-series, BL4S200 and BL5S220.
  Please read Application Note AN421 for details on the use
  of this new functionality.

- Wi-Fi Enterprise Authentication is now supported.  This feature
  is sold separately in the Rabbit Embedded Security Pack.

- Added an HTTP client library with samples (http client.c,
  dyndns.c added to Samples/tcpip/http).

- Added libraries and samples to download files from HTTP (web)
  or FTP servers and store them on a FAT filesystem.  See
  Samples/tcpip/http/http2fat.c and Samples/tcpip/ftp/ftp2fat.c.

- FAT filesystem now supported on unused portion of RCM4400W
  serial data flash and serial boot flash of BL4S100-series boards.

  Since the RCM4400W uses part of the serial flash to bootstrap its
  FPGA, you should ensure that your program does not try to access
  the serial flash during the first call to sock_init().  If your
  program has written to the flash before calling sock_init(), be
  sure to spin on sf_isWriting() to ensure that the write is complete.

		while (sf_isWriting()) {
			// waiting for write to complete before calling sock_init
		}
		sock_init();

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs

Library Bugs
- Fixed bug where FTP client library could fail on some
  multi-line responses.
- Fixed compiler error message when using xbee_api.lib with
  Rabbit 5000.
- Defect #26902: TCP/IP stack now uses a random starting value for
  the local port on outbound socket connections.  Previous behavior
  of using a fixed value (1024) would cause failures when re-running
  sample programs before remote server socket exited timewait state.
- Defect #27981: Replaced x[get|set][int|long|float] functions with
  macros that use far pointer casts.  Should result in improved
  performance.  Original functions are still available with an
  underscore prefix (e.g., _xgetint() for xgetint()).  New code
  should make use of far pointers instead of these helper macros.
- Defect #28627: dc_timestamp global moved from BIOS to
  PROGRAM.LIB and only compiled into programs if referenced in
  user code.  Also, dc_timestamp is now set to GMT instead of
  GMT-0700.  Note that macro _DC_GMT_TIMESTAMP_ is the preferred
  method for referencing the compile timestamp within your program.
- Defect #28763 fixed.  Improved baud calculations for pktXopen,
  return value now allows for up to 5% error in calculated rate.
  Fixed pktEopen (was using incorrect TATxR register).  serXopen
  and pktXopen functions now use a common set of functions for
  setting timers.
- Defect #29709 fixed. User block writes to 16-bit (word write)
  parallel flash that end with a single byte on an even address
  boundary are now handled correctly.
- Defect #29707 fixed.  Compile-time macro IFC_WIFI_RTS_THRESHOLD
  was being ignored and IFC_WIFI_FRAG_THRESHOLD was used in its
  place.  Could cause misconfiguration if IFC_WIFI_FRAG_THRESHOLD
  was set to a valid value for IFS_WIFI_RTS_THRESHOLD.
- Defect #29800: Fixed bugs in _f_strtol.
- Defect #30021: Fixed bugs in _f_strstr.
- Defect 30186 fixed. Boards equipped with ASIX Ethernet now
  reliably recover link after a cable unplug, replug sequence.

Gui Bugs

Sample Program Bugs
- Defect #29097 fixed. The Samples\memory_usage.c standard sample
  now reports the correct size of the interrupt vector tables
  and the full 12-bit segment base value of logical addresses.
- Defect #29680 fixed. The Samples\UserBlock\userblock_read_write.c
  standard sample program has been renamed to reserved_read_write.c
  and updated to give a more informative error message when run on
  any Rabbit board that does not have an area in its User block
  that is reserved for calibration constants.

Rabbit Field Utility (RFU) Bugs
- Defect #30269 fixed.  The RFU window could appear off-screen when
  launched on systems with multiple displays.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
- Math-related libraries (fft.lib, math.lib, ecc.lib, rand.lib)
  moved to "Math" subdirectory, along with new crc32.lib.
- SFLASH.LIB now contains default settings for each board type
  (core module or SBC) that includes a serial flash.  If using
  your own serial flash device, you will need to set the
  configuration macros in your program before loading sflash.lib.
- Added .pro files to Utilities\X-CTU with defaults for the
  XBee-USB adapter, XBee modules connected to the RF board and
  XBee modules connected to Rabbit core modules and SBCs.
- Support for FAT12 filesystems in FAT.LIB has been deprecated.
  New partitions can only be formatted as FAT16, and FAT12
  partitions can only be read if the macro FAT_FAT12 is defined.
- The RCM4XXX.LIB library was deprecated and its functions moved
  into LOWPOWER.LIB.

Library Bugs
- Defect #28314 fixed. snprintf now always null-terminates the
  buffer and it correctly returns the number of characters that
  would have been copied to the buffer if it had been large enough.
- Defect #28392 fixed. Only Rabbit boards with > 1 MByte total
  physical memory map have the "no_lcall" reserve memory org
  allocated.
- Defect #28450 fixed. The size of the "user_block" reserve
  memory org is now adjusted, if necessary, to suit each Rabbit
  board type.
- Defect #28679 fixed. The _enableClockModulation() function now
  correctly uses the CLOCK_DOUBLED macro value to determine the
  appropriate spectrum spreader setting.
- Defect #28999 fixed. RabbitWeb was incorrectly using the string
  "checked" instead of "selected" when generating option lists
  (print_select zhtml command).  Bug from 10.40 release.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs

Library Bugs
- Defect #22372 fixed. In RNET.LIB, the rn_find() function now
  correctly supports searching for RabbitNet devices by specified
  port(s).
- Defect #23055 fixed.  HDLC_PACKET.LIB now uses HDLC_INT_LEVEL
  for all ipset calls (some calls were hard-coded to 1).
- Defect #23787 fixed.  XBEE_API.LIB now properly includes code
  inclusion guards.
- Defect #23987 fixed.  All multicast UDP frames that have a
  destination address that the network stack is not listening for
  are now properly dropped.
- Defect #24252 fixed.  Switching between Wi-Fi encryption types
  at runtime sometimes failed.  This now works correctly.
- Defect #24366 fixed.  TCP connections to peers with large
  receive windows no longer time out or reset.
- Defect #25283 fixed.  The XBEE_API.LIB's _zb_Alloc_apif()
  function now returns NULL instead of 0 to eliminate a compile
  time warning.
- Defect #25307 fixed.  A PPP crash due to a possible stack
  imbalance in SERLINK.LIB's common ISR has been eliminated.
- Defect #25369 fixed.  Eliminated a compile time error due to
  auto / const conflict in RCM4XXX.LIB's digInAlert() function.
- Defect #25452 fixed.  The FTP server could prematurely abort
  sending files of unknown size (e.g., if the file being sent is
  being generated on-the-fly).
- Defect #25481 fixed.  Rabbit 4000 Ethernet driver sometimes
  stopped transmitting when there are a large number of collisions.
- Defect #26136 fixed.  Wi-Fi interface's link LED and link status
  (as reported by ifpending(), for example) now match.  Also fixes
  problem with the link not being reported as up when configured for
  multiple encryption types but connecting to an open Access Point.
  Note that in most cases, an incorrect encryption key will cause the
  link to not come up; however, for WEP, the link will be reported as
  being up even though the key is incorrect.  This is because WEP
  does not provide a way of determining that an incorrect key has
  been used.
- Defect #26204 fixed.  Incorrect #asm block accesses of the auto
  int statusbyte variable in the Lib\RabbitNet\RNET_KEYIF.LIB
  library's rn_keyProcess() function have been fixed.  As a
  result of this fix, the Samples\RabbitNet\RN1600\zmenu.c sample
  in particular now works correctly when making keypad menu
  selections.
- Defect #26587 fixed.  For boards using the Rabbit's built-in
  Ethernet MAC (RCM40xx), pd_powerdown() and pd_powerup() can now be
  used to turn the MAC off and on.
- xbee_api.lib: zb_reply() now uses correct cluster ID in response.

Gui Bugs

Sample Program Bugs
- Defect #26509 fixed. WiFiScanAssociate.c will now switch Access
  Points properly when the new AP has the same WPA passphrase but
  different SSIDs as the old AP.
- Defect #24086 fixed.  Fixed sleep time calculations in SleepMode
  and SleepMode2 samples (in Samples/RCM4510W/ZigBee/).
- Defect #24093 fixed. The Samples\Rabbit4000\ic_test.c standard
  sample program now scales its TAT8R register value
  appropriately, based on the Rabbit board's actual freq_divider
  value.
- Defect #25398 fixed.  updpages.c and ftp_fat.c samples now work
  with FTP clients (like FileZilla) that establish multiple,
  simultaneous connections.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- RCM4400W: The wifi_ioctl() function and related compile-time macros
  used to configure the Wi-Fi interface have been deprecated.  New
  commands for ifconfig() replace the wifi_ioctl() commands; view the
  ifconfig() function help for details on the new IFS_WIFI_* and
  IFG_WIFI_* commands.  View the function help for TCPCONFIG for
  information on the new IFC_WIFI_* compile-time macros.

- Removed current versioning comments and macros from the
  following former module libraries that are now bundled with
  Dynamic C (deleted macro, affected libraries):
   Modbus (_MODBUS_VERS, modbus_master.lib, modbus_slave.lib);
   PPP (_PPP_VERS, chat.lib, modem.lib, ppp.lib, pppoe.lib);

    os_mem.c, os_mutex.c, os_q.c, os_sem.c, os_task.c, os_time.c,
    ucos2.lib).

- XBee Libraries: created xbee_config.lib for configuration options.

- XBee Libraries: now passes payload length as second parameter to
  end point functions (see updated Samples/ZigBee/EndPoint.c).

- XBee Libraries: Removed 1x18 firmware and added 1x41 firmware as
  default.

- Utilities/X-CTU now includes the installer for X-CTU v5.1.0.0 and
  ZNet 2.5 1x41 firmware.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #21428 fixed. Structs of any size can now be added to the watch
  window. The amount of data actually read from the target will be
  limited by the size of Watch memory defined in the Environment Options.
- Defect #21442 fixed. Leading blanks are now ignored in lib.dir entries.
- Defect #21614 fixed. The memory leak in the Environment Options dialog
  has been fixed.
- Defect #21773 fixed. Single step debug cursor placement for library code
  had been off by the number of blank lines after the start of library
  function descriptions.
- Defect #22027 fixed. Trailing blanks are now ignored in lib.dir entries.
- Defect #23043 fixed. WiFi ad-hoc beacon time reduced from ~26 seconds to
  ~100 ms.
- Defect #80867 fixed. The compiler now requires forward declared
  cofunctions to be prototypes (This was actually fixed in 10.09).

Library Bugs
- Defect #20120 fixed. Defining USE_FAR_LIB_API was causing code crashes
  on programs which enabled ethernet on 4xxx cores with ASIX hardware.
- Defect #20238 fixed. UCos-II samples (ucosdemo3.c, ucosdelreq.c,
  JackRab\UCOSJRAB1.C) complain about overriding stub functions in the
  library.  Added pragmas that can be uncommented to quiet the warnings.
- Defect #20248 fixed. dhcp_check_lease did not have a case for
  DHCP_ST_EXPIRED. Added.
- Defect #20417 fixed. Root (char *) promoted to (far char *) now prints
  correctly when using printf("%ls", far_var).
- Defect #20472 fixed. PPP serial more reliable with bad link quality.
- Defect #20559 fixed. Grep dialog no longer stays on top when switching
  to another application during a time consuming grep.
- Defect #20818 fixed. __con_convert_num_to_iface function was
  updated to take into account that wifi interfaces are IF_WIFI0
  and IF_WIFI1 and that the Rabbit 3k/4k have IF_PPP4 and IF_PPP5.
- Defect #20819 fixed. __con_convert_iface_to_num function was
  updated to take into account that wifi interfaces are numeric
  interfaces 2 & 3 so now PPPoE and PPP interfaces get moved down
  2 spots.  However, the zconsole.lib still does not support wifi
  interfaces.
- Defect #20835 fixed. In the con_show_multi function when ifconfig
  attempts to get IFG_PPP_SENDEXPECT and IFG_PPP_HANGUP, there is no
  checking for if NULL is returned.
  Added conditional statement to check for NULL.
- Defect #20934 fixed. Resetting an FTP socket should no longer
  cause bad FTP state (reported on Windows XP FTP server)
- Defect #20939 fixed. Samples program "samples\tcpip\zserver\filesystem.c"
  compiles correctly.
- Defect #20941 fixed. Zserver.lib was not filling in FAT partition
  info to caller, causing problems with unmount/mount operations
  within filesystem.c sample program.
- Defect #21049 fixed. When RS232.LIB's serXopen functions are
  called with a baud parameter lower than can be actually
  achieved on a Rabbit 4000-based board, the lowest possible
  baud rate is now always set.  Note that the serXopen
  functions' result indicates whether or not the achieved baud
  setting is within 5% of the requested baud parameter.
- Defect #21226 fixed. Long HTTP headers no longer cause the HTTP
  connection to abort. This was causing problems on Internet Explorer
  under Windows Vista.
- Defect #21426 fixed.  Function help is now available for the
  _xalloc function.
- Defect #21467 fixed.  Fixed an off-by-one error in setting the RTS/CTS
  threshold in the WiFi driver.
- Defect #21470 fixed.  Fixed problems with setting and interpreting the
  fragmentation threshold in the WiFi driver.
- Defect #21674 fixed.  When using MS_TIMER for delays and timeouts, the
  elapsed interval should always be compared to the desired period, instead
  of direct comparisons between MS_TIMER and an end time to avoid errors when
  MS_TIMER rolls over.
- Defect #21725 fixed.  The error log's ERRLOG_PHYSICAL_ADDR
  macro value is now correctly defined in error log supporting
  compile modes.
- Defect #21780 fixed. For FLASH_COMPILE or RAM_COMPILE mode
  programs compiled to 16-bit flash and RAM memories, A19 is no
  longer inverted in the MB2CR or MB3CR quadrants.  Note that
  the A19 inversion is of no consequence to memories of size 256
  KWords (512 KBytes) or smaller.
- Defect #21828 fixed. A copy of the system macros table is now
  available for use by the _GetSysMacro* functions in "Code and
  BIOS in RAM" compile mode.
- Defect #22044 fixed.  When DCRTCP is not defined, ZCONSOLE.LIB
  no longer #uses the network configuration save support
  library.  This eliminates "XXX is out of scope / not declared"
  error messages when compiling the basicconsole.c or
  loginconsole.c standard samples.
- Defect #22050 fixed.  When resolving multiple host names that
  are a mix of "dotted decimal" and name-type URLs, DNS.LIB's
  DNS request counter is now always incremented and decremented
  in a balanced fashion.
- Defect #22054 fixed.  The non-API repl_getCurrentNetworkConfig
  library support function is now properly prototyped and
  exposed for use by other library API functions.  This
  eliminates the "Undefined (but used) global label" error when
  compiling the userblock_tcpipconsole.c standard sample.
- Defect #22055 fixed.  Fixed a problem where changing SSIDs would
  sometimes not trigger a new association with the WiFi driver.
- Defect #22068 fixed.  Incorrect comparisons of types char vs.
  NULL in ZCONSOLE.LIB's con_set_param and con_set_tcpip_debug
  functions have been corrected to compare char vs. char.
- Defect #22091 fixed.  RS232_NOCHARASSYINBRK now turns on "no character
  assembly in break" while in STDIO_DEBUG_SERIAL mode.  If STDIO_DEBUG_SERIAL
  == SADR on a Rabbit 4000 (or greater), this is now the default behavior.
- Defect #22094 fixed. The redundant xrelease() function help
  header is removed from XMEM.LIB.
- Defect #22095 fixed. Modified documentation for rand16_range().
- Defect #22255 fixed.  By default, excluded flash driver
  variables and code which are not normally necessary in "Code
  and BIOS in RAM" compile mode.
- Defect #22730 fixed. Compilation errors in samples/LowPower/lp_ping.c
  and lp_smtp.c
- Defect #22910 fixed. SYS.LIB's useMainOsc and 32khzOsc
  functions now check the current oscillator(s) setting to avoid
  making unwanted oscillator setting changes.  The unwanted
  settings changes particularly affected programs run in debug
  no-poll mode, preventing Dynamic C from detecting end-of-
  program.
- Defect #22945 fixed. The Nflash library had compiler errors when
  NFLASH_DEBUG switch was enabled.
- Defect #22950 fixed. The ADC library for RCM4xxx modules had
  unsigned int return values for several functions that needed a
  signed value.  This caused negative error conditions to produce
  incorrect large positive readings back to the caller.
- Defect #22995 fixed. ADC calibration fails with non-default gain running
  adc_cal_chan.c or adc_cal_all.c on RCM4xxx core.
- Defect #23075 fixed. Incorrect calibration of analog channel on RCM4100.
- Defect #23095 fixed.  When USE_FAR_LIB_API or USE_FAR_STRING_LIB
  was defined, several "call memcpy" asm instructions in ASIX.LIB,
  REALTEK.LIB and SMSC.LIB were changed to "call _f_memcpy"
  inappropriately.
- Defect #23133 fixed.  The SxER registers and SxERShadow variables
  are now all initialized to their HW reset state on BIOS startup.
  In particular, this fixes STDIO redirection problems due to reliance
  on uninitialized shadow register values.
- Defect #23240 fixed. ioconfig_switchecho.c, double output possible due to
  shared variable between costates.
- Defect #23256 fixed.  When using TICK_TIMER for delays and timeouts, the
  elapsed interval should always be compared to the desired period, instead
  of direct comparisons between TICK_TIMER and an end time to avoid errors
  when TICK_TIMER rolls over.
- Defect #23552 fixed. Switching power modes with set_cpu_power_mode() could
  sometimes cause a crash on the RCM40xx series core modules.
- Defect #23638 fixed. sspec_readvariable() in ZSERVER.LIB could return
  incorrect values for a variable of type INT8.
- Defect #23720 fixed. The help description for sspec_setfvlen() in
  ZSERVER.LIB has been corrected (NULL terminator should be included in
  PTR16 lengths).
- Defect #23806 fixed.  Rabbit 4000's HDLC_PACKET.LIB asm
  instruction mnemonic "pd" typo has been corrected to read "ld"
  instead.
- Defect #23818 fixed.  On the RCM4400W, calling tcp_tick() no
  longer corrupts IX register content.  This fix allows RCM4400W
  applications that call tcp_tick() within costates or
  cofunctions to work correctly.
- Defect #81642 fixed. HDLC driver had an incorrect check for CPU being used.
- Defect #81697 fixed. _WriteFlashByteX and _WriteFlashWord no longer cause a
  stack imbalance when a write into the user/System ID block is detected.

Gui Bugs
- Defect #21215 fixed. Project changes can now be made after compiling and
  before returning to edit mode.
- Defect #21315 fixed. Characters less than 0x20 now show as '.' on the right
  side of dump windows.

- Defect #21879 fixed. Edit window misbehavior from selecting Message window
  items is fixed.
- Defect #81439 fixed. Grep in files with *.* mask now runs without error.
- Defect #81450 fixed. Copy-and-paste containing tabs now works
  properly. (Note that this bug was actually fixed in Dynamic C
  version 10.09.)
- Defect #81483 fixed. Project open/close will now cancel if
  modified file close query is cancelled. (Note that this bug was
  actually fixed in Dynamic C version 9.30.)
- Defect #81689 fixed. Dynamic C: Serial No. Dialog now appears center-screen
  on a dual-monitor system.

Sample Program Bugs
- Defect #20941 fixed. Zserver.lib was not filling in FAT partition
  info to caller, causing problems with unmount/mount operations
  within filesystem.c sample program.
- Defect #21800 fixed.  Unused input capture ISR code is removed
  from the qd_phase_10bit.c standard sample program.
- Defect #22730 fixed. The \Samples\LowPower\lp_ping.c and lp_smtp.c
  were missing configuration for RCM4xxx modules causing compilation
  errors.  Configuration for all released RCM4xxx modules added.
- Defect #22804 fixed. The \Samples\SysClock\test_32khz_3000.c
  standard sample has been renamed to test_32khz_3000_4000.c and
  updated with support for blinky LEDs on the RCM4xxx
  prototyping board.
- Defect #22805 fixed.  The Samples\SysClock\Test_Osc3000.c
  standard sample has been renamed to Test_Osc3000_4000.c and
  updated accordingly to work with a selection of both Rabbit
  3000 and 4000 targets.
- Defect #23004 fixed. The \Samples\Filesystem\FAT\fmt_device.c sample
  did not format additional partitions correctly, only partition 0.
- Defect #23001 fixed. The \Samples\Filesystem\FAT\fmt_device.c sample
  had erratic partition mounting behavior after formatting a partition
  other than partition 0.
- Defect #22986 fixed. The \Samples\Filesystem\FAT\fmt_device.c sample
  did not handle uncondition format of device properly with multiple
  partitions on the device.
- Defect #23202 fixed.  For PPP sample programs which define
  DIALOUT_SENDEXPECT, added 1.5 second pause between modem reset
  and dial out commands for those modems which respond with an
  early OK to their modem reset command.
- Defect #23457 fixed.  The Samples\UserBlock\idblock_report.c
  standard sample now includes RCM4400W board information.
- Defect #23645 fixed.  Corrected a logic error in checking the high
  temperature in Samples\TCPIP\HTTP\form1.c .
- Defect #81695 fixed.  In Samples\RTCLOCK\SETRTCKB.C, added check for years
  entered as more than 2 digits.  Added date range notification to stdio
  window.

Debugger Bugs

  side.

Command Line Compiler Bugs
- Defect #22083 fixed. Typo corrected in help to Poll target while running.

IOConfig Utility Bugs
- Defect #22147 fixed. The IOConfig utility now sets up serial port D DMA
  correctly and the serial port works correctly after calling the generated
  function.
- Defect #23088 fixed. Erroneous warnings about other serial
  ports' setup interfering with debugging via serial port A
  have been eliminated; valid warnings occur when appropriate.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- The Rabbit 4000 CPU's advanced 16-bit memory mode has a defect
  which affects ioe instructions (auxiliary I/O, external I/O)
  and self-timed chip select.  The Dynamic C BIOS has been
  updated to work around this ioe defect on affected boards, all
  of the RCM40xx family.  If absolute top performance is required
  and the User is certain their application is unaffected by the
  ioe bug, the work around can be disabled by adding the
  __ALLOW_16BIT_AUXIO_DEFECT macro into Dynamic C's Project
  Options Defines Box.  See the Rabbit 4000 Users Manual Appendix
  B (errata section) or TN255 for complete details.
- The RCM4xxx board-specific ioconfig_switchecho.c sample and
  related RCM4*_IOCONFIG.LIB libraries are updated to also
  demonstrate configuration of serial port D with DMA enabled.
- The wifi_ioctl() API function has slightly different semantics for some
  commands.  In particular, many of the commands require that the WiFi
  network interface is brought down before the command is accepted.  See the
  function help (Ctrl-H) for wifi_ioctl() for details.  Application code
  should ensure that the return code from wifi_ioctl() is checked after
  each call.
- WiFi Protected Access (WPA), with Pre-Shared Key (PSK), is now available
  for applications which require robust privacy and integrity.  In order to
  use WPA/PSK, define WIFI_USE_WPA plus a suitable ascii passphrase
  or hexadecimal key, and define _WIFI_WEP_FLAG to WIFICONF_WEP_TKIP.  See
  samples\rcm4400w\tcpip\pingled_wpa_psk.c for more details.  More
  documentation on the relevant macros may be found by performing a Function
  Lookup (Ctrl+H) on TCPCONFIG.
- In order to be acceptable to various countries' regulatory authorities,
  there is an improved API for customizing the WiFi library to conform to
  the radio regulations.  The wifi_ioctl() API function has new commands to
  query and set the channel list and transmit power.  The commands are
  WIFI_MULTI_DOMAIN which allows automatic configuration via 802.11d capable
  access points; WIFI_COUNTRY_SET which allows one of several known
  regulatory domains to be configured; WIFI_COUNTRY_GET which queries the
  current regulatory domain information.

  updated to take into account that wifi interfaces are numeric
  interfaces 2 & 3 so now PPPoE and PPP interfaces get moved down
  2 spots.  However, the zconsole.lib still does not support wifi
  interfaces.
- Defect #20835 fixed. In the con_show_multi function when ifconfig
  attempts to get IFG_PPP_SENDEXPECT and IFG_PPP_HANGUP, there is no

  a zero parameter, and now prints an error message asking for
  the required data structure.
- Defect #81613 fixed. Error log exception values changed.
- Defect #81657 fixed. On the ASIX AX88796 Ethernet chip, when

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

- The RCM40xx Product Family has been separated with individual
  Product IDs. Specifically, in Dynamic C 10.07, the macro,
  RCM4000A, has been redefined to the product id for an RCM4000
  (PID=0x2702). Likewise, the macro, RCM4010, is now defined to
  the product ID for an RCM4010 (PID=0x2701). The boards'
  internal product ID part numbers have not changed, just the
  macro value definitions in this version of Dynamic C.  Previous
  versions of Dynamic C 10 used the macro RCM4000A to identify
  the RCM4010 (PID=2701).

- Error logging is updated to version 2. Run time exceptions are
  now reported / recorded as negative int values and Dynamic C's
  traditional run time error codes have changed. See details in
  Lib\errno.lib and in Lib\BiosLib\errors.lib.

- DLM/DLP programs in Samples\Download do not work with Rabbit
  4000 processors. These programs were changed to reflect this.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES

*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.03

NEW FEATURES

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs

  generate an error message.
- Defect #80990 fixed. Empty function chains no longer generate
  prolog and epilog code.
- Defect #81548 fixed. The assembler produces an intelligible
  error message for trailing '+' or '-' characters in an
  instruction.

  page boundaries when encountering inline c expressions embedded
  in assembly code.
- Defect #81593 fixed. The compiler now properly promotes NULL
  pointer constants to the type of the other operand in equality
  comparisons provided the other operand is a pointer type.
- Defect #81599 fixed. The compiler now uses labels instead of
  pseudocompilation to generate function blocks for cofunction
  related code.
- Defect #81600 fixed. The RdPortI() inline function now produces
  an error message for undefined variables as parameters.

  These errors were located in the network stack and appeared as
  failures in the gateway/router services.
- Defect #81590 fixed.  RabbitFLEX keypads with other than 2
  outputs now work correctly.  Also, this change will cause the
  outputs on a 2-output keypad to swap, so reported keycodes on
  a 2-output keypad will change.
- Defect #81596 fixed. The library file "http.lib" compares the
  value of a state structure member instead of the pointer.
- Defect #81603 fixed.  RS232.LIB DMA transmit is now redesigned

*****************************************************************
VERSION 10.01

NOTE: Dynamic C version 10.01 is supported only on the RCM4110
      core module.  Attempting to compile a program to any other
      Rabbit Core Module will result in a compile-time error.

NEW FEATURES
- Far Pointers and Far Data. The "far" keyword allows for direct
  access to xmem, without having to use xmem2root, root2xmem, or
  other library routines. A new library API for standard
  functions is provided to work with far pointers.
- Rabbit 4000 CPU code generation. DC 10.01 introduces support
  for the Rabbit 4000 CPU and generates native code from C
  source.
- Improved code generation. DC 10.01 has improved code generation
  over older Dynamic C releases, including the use of new Rabbit
  4000 instructions to produce smaller, faster binaries.
- Rabbit I/O LIB Utility. This utility is a powerful tool
  for initializing I/O pins and various Rabbit 4000 peripherals.
- DMA support. The Rabbit 4000 supports Direct Memory Access for
  data transfers between I/O and memory. A full set of API are
  provided in the new DMA.LIB
- Highly configurable serial libraries. RS232 serial API have
  been enhanced to support generalization. This allows for more
  maintainable and transferable code. RS232 also now supports
  DMA for less interrupt intensive serial transfers.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #81546 fixed. Constant structure assignment is fixed.
- Defect #81550 fixed. Removed improper warning for functions
  returning function pointer types using typedef.
- Defect #81556 fixed. Float to unsigned long conversion fixed.
- Defect #81557 fixed. Accessing multi-dimensional arrays with
  constant indices fixed.

  in #asm const blocks.
- Defect #81570 fixed. Corrected removeram origin directive
  definition, fixing problems with running in RAM mode.
- Defect #81577 fixed. Added a definition for the removeram
  origin directive for compiling in Flash Mode.
- Defect #81582 fixed. The sizeof operator resulted in incorrect
  values when calculating the size of the address of an array.

Library Bugs
- Defect #81151 fixed. The functions clockDoublerOn,
  clockDoublerOff, and setClockModulation do not compile.
- Defect #81563 fixed. Missing function prototypes for
  clockDoublerOn and setClockModulation were added.

GUI Bugs
- Defect #81572 fixed.  The compiler messages window no longer
  leaks memory each time it is opened.
- Defect #81574 fixed.  Dynamic C no longer crashes if a program
  that loses communication before starting (yet runs to
  completion) is recompiled.
- Defect #81576 fixed.  Switch to debug mode (Shift+F5) now
  works correctly for programs compiled to RAM.

Debugger Bugs
- Defect #81573 fixed.  Pressing F4 when a program is running on
  a BL1810 now stops the program from running and returns the
  IDE to edit mode.
- Defect #81575 fixed.  Returning to edit mode after compiling a
  program and turning on execution tracing no longer results in
  a target communication timeout.
- Defect #81585 fixed.  Setting a watch expression no longer
  corrupts data 1k below dkcWriteBufHeader in non-separate I&D.

OTHER FUNCTIONAL CHANGES
- Conversion of negative float values to unsigned long values,
  which is undefined C behavior, has changed.  Previously, the
  float value's 32-bit representation was copied literally into
  the unsigned long's 32-bits.  Now, conversion of a negative
  float value to unsigned long type results in the value 0ul.
  This change in behavior is coincident with the fix for defect
  #81556.  Also note that the similarly undefined behavior for
  conversion of negative float values to unsigned int type has
  not yet changed; however, the equivalent change will occur in a
  future release of Dynamic C.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 9.41

NEW FEATURES
- Samples, libraries and documentation added to support the new
  customizable RabbitFLEX boards.
- Dynamic C's LIB.DIR library files list mechanism now searches
  for library files within a specified directory tree. The option
  to specify a complete or relative pathlist to each individual
  library file remains. Note that each library file name must
  be unique, regardless of whether the library is explicitly
  specified or is found via searching a specified directory tree.
  Also note that this feature was actually implemented in Dynamic
  C v. 9.30.

  which has a new LCD controller.  The updated libraries work
  with both old and new versions of the OP72xx.  A BIN file
  created using the new libraries will also work with both old
  and new versions of the OP72xx.  (Note that the old libraries
  will not work with the new OP72xx.)

- Improved assembly language error reporting.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs
- Integer promotion rules now match ANSI C. This may cause some
  new warnings to appear in older Dynamic C programs. In rare
  cases, legacy code that relies on the original behavior could
  be wrong (primarily in character to integer promotions).
- Defect #80437 fixed. Stack imbalance problem with certain C
  expressions.
- Defect #80476 fixed. Using operator /= with field accessed from
  a structure pointer with sizeof expression causes stack
  imbalance.
- Defect #80532 fixed. Character shift and multiply in test
  expressions was broken for certain values.
- Defect #80533 fixed. Comparison between char and long return
  types (i.e. longfoo() != charfoo()) generated an internal
  error.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 9.01

NEW FEATURES
- Execution Tracing - Traces at each statement, each
  function, or customer inserted points. Displays results
  in the Trace window. The options for execution tracing
  are configurable. This feature is disabled by default.
- Stack Tracing - Helps customers find out the path of the
  program at each single step or break point. By looking
  through the stack, it is possible to reconstruct the path
  and allow the customer to easily move backwards in the
  current call tree to get a better feeling for the current
  debugging context.
- Persistent Breakpoints - Persistent breakpoints mean the
  information is retained when transitioning back and forth
  from edit mode to debug mode and when a file is closed and
  re-opened.
- Enhanced Watch Expressions - The Watches window is now a
  tree structure capable of showing struct members. That is,
  all members of a structure become viewable as watch
  expressions when a structure is added, without having to add
  them each separately.
- Enhanced Memory Dumps - Changed data in the Memory Dump
  window is highlighted in reverse video or in customizable
  colors every time you single step in either C or assembly.
- Enhanced Mode Switching - Debug mode can be entered
  without a recompile and download. If the contents of the
  debugged program are edited, Dynamic C prompts for a
  recompile.
- Enhanced Stdio Window - The Stdio window is directly
  searchable.
- Enhanced bookmark support - Bookmark menu items are
  checked when the corresponding bookmark is set, and
  unchecked when the corresponding bookmark is not set.
  When a book mark is set, the menu item also displays
  the line of text as well as the column and line number
  where the bookmark is placed. See Edit | Toggle Bookmark,
  Edit | Goto Bookmark, and Editor window popup menu.
- Samples, libraries, and documentation added for new RCM3360
  and RCM3370 boards equipped with soldered-on and/or socketed
  nand flash devices.  (Note that the RCM3300's Remote
  Application Upload requires serial flash, and so is
  incompatible with the new nand flash equipped RCM3360 and
  RCM3370 boards.)
- Support for SMTP Auth added to SMTP library.
- TCP/IP stack has been reorganized to dramatically reduce
  the amount of root data memory used.  This change frees
  up almost 6k of root data memory, which will allow
  applications which are constrained by root memory (code
  and/or data) to be enhanced.  If the application is
  constrained by available root code space, the definition
  of DATAORG may be increased by one or two pages (4 or
  8k) to allow additional root code functions.  Applications
  which need more root data space can just use the
  additional root data space.
- TCP/IP packet buffers used to default to 10 packets of
  600 bytes each, stored in root data space.  This version
  now defaults to 10 packets of 1536 bytes each, in xmem.
  The xmem buffers are allocated in units of 512 bytes,
  and default to 30 buffers.  These buffers are shared
  amongst the default 10 packets.  The number of packets
  is specified using #define ETH_MAXBUFS.  Each packet
  uses a small amount of root data space (currently 48 bytes
  each).  The data buffers, in xmem, are specified using
  #define PKT_XBUFS to the number of 512-byte chunks desired.
  This defaults to 30. In order to take advantage of the
  larger buffer space available, the default interface
  MTU has been increased to 1500 (from 600).  This
  should produce an immediate performance improvement for
  applications which handle bulk network data.
- TCP/IP stack packet (ethernet) drivers have been
  reorganized so that more than one type of packet driver
  may be included in the same application program.  This is
  to support future products which have more than one
  ethernet interface, or which do not know which ethernet
  device is on-board until runtime.
- POOL.LIB has high-speed allocation/deallocation and
  linked-list handling functions, in addition to the
  previous C implementations.

- Defect #81257 fixed. The smsc_writephy function returns
  incorrect values if uC/OS-II is defined. This effects the
  pd_havelink and prt_nicreg functions for the smsc based
  boards (RCM3400 and RCM3300).
- Defect #81258 fixed. Selection variables in RabbitWeb can
  now additionally have guard expressions.

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #81256 fixed.  The PCDR register is no longer set
  to 0x40 at cold boot time, preventing bits 0/2/4/6
  transition on Rabbit 3000 CPUs and bit 6 transition on Rabbit
  2000 CPUs. RabbitBios.c is also updated to prevent start
  up transitions on these bits after hardware reset.  If
  the BIOS's previous transition behavior is desired, add
  _ZW_RESET_PCDR_ALL_ZEROS into the "Options > Project
  Options > Defines" tab.
- Defect #81264 fixed.  Auto "protected" variables allowed
  (but not protected) and local static protected variables
  disallowed.
- Defect #81273 fixed.  Long labels in the assembler (>= 32
  characters) no longer cause odd errors.
- Defect #81261 fixed.  Pointer checking incorrectly reports
  runtime exceptions for battery backed root variables error
  under Code and BIOS in Flash, Run in RAM compile mode.

Other Functional Changes
- TCP/IP:
  Ping responses are supported up to a maximum of 982 bytes.
  This is a reduction from previous versions, but is
  necessary for reasonable efficiency.  If using a ping
  command from a host such as ping -s 1000 10.10.6.100
  (which specifies 1000 bytes of data) then only the first
  982 bytes will be echoed.  Default ping commands will
  usually only send 56 bytes of data, so this should not
  be a problem in practice.

  The old style of TCP/IP configuration (using MY_IP_ADDRESS,
  MY_NETMASK, etc.) must be slightly modified to work with the
  new packet drivers.  The macro USE_ETHERNET must be defined
  to 1 before the "#use dcrtcp.lib" line.  Also, a warning will
  be issued if the macro TCPCONFIG is not defined.  If you are
  using the old style configuration, TCPCONFIG should be defined
  to 0.  We do, however, recommend migrating to the new style of
  configuration using the TCPCONFIG macro, the TCP_CONFIG.LIB
  library, and the ifconfig() function.

VERSION 8.61

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #81224 fixed.  The BIOS is only recompiled when
  necessary.
- Defect #81228.  Duplicate string literals in differents
  scopes may cause the compiler to crash or fail to compile.

TCP/IP Bugs
- Defect #81227 fixed.  A warning is now issued when
  SSPEC_MAX_OPEN is less than HTTP_MAXSERVERS or
  FTP_MAXSERVERS.  Setting SSPEC_MAX_OPEN too low
  (it is 4 by default) causes spurious "404 Not Found"
  errors in the HTTP server when it is under load.
  The "404 Not Found" message in this case has
  also been changed to a "503 Service Unavailable" message.
- Defect #81231 fixed.  Some cases where #web guard
  expressions were not generated correctly have been fixed.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 8.51

NEW FEATURES
- Ethernet Support for RCM3700.
- BOOTP.LIB (BOOTP and DHCP support for TCP/IP) rewritten
  to be non-blocking and support multiple interfaces.
  dhcp_release() and dhcp_acquire() have been deprecated in
  favor of bringing the interface down and up using the
  normal ifconfig() function.  Processing of DHCP options has
  been made more flexible, via a callback function.  Support
  for automatic TFTP download of the boot file has been
  removed since it is too unwieldy for multiple i/f usage.
  Some global variables (such as _survivebootp) have been
  removed. The equivalent functionality is provided via more
  ifconfig() options. DHCP now works as part of the normal
  interface startup, driven via tcp_tick().  It uses fewer
  resources.  In particular, worst-case stack usage has
  dropped to under 1k from over 2k.  Fewer xmem and root data
  resources are required.  No UDP socket is required.
- DNS.LIB enhanced to use facilities of new SERVLIST.LIB.
  SERVLIST manages prioritized lists of IP addresses which
  represent server resources.  In particular, DNS, the name
  resolver, now uses a DNS server list.  This has the benefit
  of being able to mix predefined DNS servers together with
  DNS servers discovered via DHCP or PPP negotiation.
- Support for SSL and HTTPS.
- Added xgetfloat and xsetfloat functions to get and set a
  floating point value in xmem
- Floating point support can be conditionally compiled out
  of stdio.lib by adding #define STDIO_DISABLE_FLOATS to either
  a user program or the Defines tab page in the Project
  Options dialog.  This can save several thousand bytes of
  code space.
- Three new format specifiers have been added to the printf
  family of functions:
   * %ls specifies a NULL terminated string in xmem.
   * %p  specifies a 16-bit logical pointer.
   * %lp specifies a 32-bit physical pointer.
- Support for printing strings longer than 127 bytes has
  been added to stdio.lib.  A new macro,
  STDIO_ENABLE_LONG_STRINGS must be defined in either the user
  program or in the Defines tab page in the Project Options
  dialog (the library does not define this macro by default).
  Special care must be taken in a multi-tasking application
  where different tasks may be printing strings that are
  longer than 128 bytes so that output from different tasks
  is not interleaved in the stdio window.  For instance, a
  semaphore could be used by different tasks in a uC/OS-II
  application that need to print long strings to serialize
  access to printf.
- User can now add serial ports to Serial Port combobox in
  Communications tab of Project Options dialog.
- The command line compiler normally compiles and runs the
  specified source file, but now when the project file
  "Default Compile Mode" is one of the options which compiles
  to a .bin file, the command line compiler will not
  run the program but will compile the source to a .bin file.
- Provides stronger built-in support for certain large sector
  flash devices; in particular, the LS support files from
  tn226.zip are no longer required.  See Tech Note 226 for a
  list of supported flash devices, and a description of the
  limitations of support for LS flash devices.

Command line Compiler
- Defect #80927 fixed.  Help message printed for -b flag was
  incorrect.
- Defect #80972 fixed.  The command line compiler -rf switch
  now reads data correctly for a targetless compile to a file.
- Defect #81050 fixed.  The command line compiler reads
  libraries from a user defined lib.dir file in the project
  file, if one exists.
- Defect #81053 fixed.  The command line compiler now uses
  the files given with the -lf, -bf, -clf and -pbf switches
  correctly.
- Defect #81150 fixed.  The command line compiler will now
  honor the compile mode setting specified in the project file.
- Defect #81158 fixed.  The command line compiler will now
  properly handle a relative given for a project file with
  the -pf switch.

  packets from being sent before driver init.
- Defect #81143 fixed. is_subnet_bcast_addr() and
  is_subnet_net_addr() modified for support of non-standard
  subnet masks.
- Defect #81146 fixed. Multicasting caused lockup in
  board(s) using the ASIX chip. RMBC1,2 registers cleared
  before aborting remote DMA, as dictated by NE2000 specs.

Debugger Bugs
- Defect #80807 fixed. All breakpoints can now unconditionally
  be reset.
- Defect #80929 fixed. Single stepping over an lcall
  to a debuggable pure assembly function with the
  assembly window open no longer causes stack corruption.
- Defect #80958 fixed. Watch data is now correct for
  a watch that is automatically reloaded at program
  startup and that is set on the address of a local
  static variable where global variables are declared
  between function prototypes and the function in which
  the variable being watched occurs.
- Defect #80963 fixed. Data in af' register is not
  trashed when single stepping at the instruction level
  over a jp f,mn instruction.
- Defect #80988 fixed.  Debugger handles samples that
  use serial ports E and F correctly.  See defect #81147.
- Defect #81152 fixed. Disabling watch expressions in

  code, which can be seen in Information window.

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #80904 fixed.  Data variables are placed beginning
  exactly at the top of the data origin.

  large xstring table.
- Defect #81018 fixed.  All origin (incl. #rcodorg) collisions
  are now detected and reported.
- Defect #81027 fixed. Short-circuit evaluation for binaray
  operators && and || could generate improper fixups if
  the first operand evaluated to a constant (and thus
  optimizing out the second operand in some cases).
- Defect #81032 fixed. Dynamic C did not properly handle
  function pointers to inline-I/O functions when inline
  I/O was enabled.
- Defect #81033 fixed. When using inline-C return statements
  in #asm blocks within functions, Dynamic C would sometimes
  omit the final return in the function, even though there
  was valid code between the return statement and the end
  of the function.
- Defect #81035 fixed.  Large xdata and xstring tables are
  no longer truncated to modulo 64 KB.

RFU Bugs
- Defect #80806 fixed. The RFU no longer reqires write access to
  the drive from which it is executing and can be run from CD.
  This fix has been implemented since version 7.26.

Other Functional Changes
- Existing FTP server programs must now define the macro
  SSPEC_NO_STATIC.  This is due to changes in the underlying
  ZSERVER.LIB that makes its handling of the HTTP and FTP
  servers more uniform.  In particular, it is now possible to
  create a static resource table for the FTP server as well
  as the HTTP server. SSPEC_NO_STATIC indicates that the user
  is not creating a static resource table.
- The macro SSPEC_NO_STATIC is an alias for the old macro
  HTTP_NO_FLASHSPEC.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 8.30-B

LIBRARY BUGS
- Defect 81081 fixed. ZCONSOLE.LIB has been updated to
  reflect DNS-related changes.


VERSION 8.30

NEW FEATURES
- DHCP rewritten to be better integrated into the TCP/IP
  library suite. You can now use DHCP with multiple interfaces.
  When you bring the interface up and down, DHCP is
  automatically applied.  There are more ifconfig() options
  for setting DHCP parameters and less reliance on global
  variables.  For full details, see the library description
  at the top of lib\tcpip\bootp.lib.  The main feature of
  the old implementation which is no longer supported is
  the ability to "automatically" download a boot file using
  TFTP.  TFTP is still usable for this purpose, however
  DHCP will not do it for you.
- You can now define multiple home IP addresses on an
  ethernet interface by defining the macro VIRTUAL_ETH
  to the number of additional home addresses.  You also
  need to call the virtual_eth() function at runtime to
  define the new home addresses.  See the documentation for
  virtual_eth() for more details.
- New function send_ping_iface() to send an ICMP echo request
  on a specified network interface.
- New function aton2() for better parsing of dotted decimal
  IP address strings.
- Added IFS_NAMESERVER_DEL option for ifconfig() to remove
  nameserver entries.
- The samples\tcpip\dhcp.c sample program now demonstrates
  a lot of tcp/ip functionality

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #81025 fixed. Multiple root bouncer stubs were being
  generated for pointers to xmem functions.


TCP/IP Bugs
- Defect #80828 fixed.  DHCP problem, no longer relevant with
  new DHCP implementation.
- Defect #80942 fixed.  Bootfile download has been defeatured
  from DHCP.
- Defect #80953 fixed. In ZServer forms, null termination is
  no longer off-by-one for updating string variables.
- Defect #81021 fixed.  sock_abort() now reliably sends TCP
  RST flag.

NEW FEATURES - Gui

Editor
- Syntax highlighting - customizable via
  Options | Environment Options | Syntax Colors
- Code templates - new templates can be added via
  Options | Environment Options | Code Templates,
  and can be inserted into the editor using either
  ctrl+j or right mouse click | Insert Code Template
- Columnar selection - alt + left mouse button will
  put the editor into column mode
- Bookmarks - shift + ctrl + [0-9] will toggle a book
  mark at the current cursor location.  ctrl + [0-9]
  will return the cursor to that location.
- Many preferences can be set via Options | Environment,
  Options | Editor
- "Open file at cursor" command (on right click pop
  up menu)
- Watch expressions can be evaluated in flyover hints

Grep
- Located under Edit | Find in Files (Grep) allows
  searches to be performed in directories or in all files
  open in Dynamic C.  Regular expressions and specific
  file masks can be used.

Function Lookup
- A tree view of all libraries and all functions (with
  function descriptions) contained in each library has
  been added to the function lookup window.
- An edit button has been added to the function description
  window that opens the library in which the function
  description appears, and positions the cursor at
  the function description.

Debug Windows (General)
- Fonts and colors for debug windows can be set on the
  debug windows tab under  Options | Environment,
  Options | Debug Windows.  Fonts and colors can be set
  on a case  by case basis by choosing the desired window
  name from the window list box. Fonts and colors for the
  current debug window can be applied to all debug windows
  by pressing the "apply settings to all" button.
- Which debug windows open when a program is compiled
  can be specified on the debug windows tab.  Selecting
  "Open last used windows" will make dc8 behave like the
  7.x releases of dc.

Disassembly window
- Each column (address, machine code, opcode, and clock cycle)
  can be resized or completely turned off.
- Source line being disassembled can be shown in the window's
  output
- Clock cycle summation can be disabled.
- Window can use same syntax highlighting scheme as editor
  windows.  If this option is enabled, the font color and
  font size cannot be set via the debug windows tab under
  Options | Environment Options.  The font color and font
  size will only change if the syntax options for the editor
  change.
- A new address can be disassembled via a right click.
- The current execution address can be disassembled via a
  right click.
- A highlighted selection can either be copied to the
  clipboard or saved to a file.

Stdio window
- This window can be set to automatically scroll vertically
  and/or horizontally.
- Output can wrap at a defined column (default to 80)

Register window
- This window retains the current style of output, and adds
  a new view which is selectable either via a right mouse
  click on the window or on the debug windows tab under
  Options | Environment Options.  If the old style is
  selected, it is possible to change register contents by
  right clicking anywhere on the window and selecting
  "Change Register Value(s)". If the new style is selected,
  right clicking on an editable register will bring up a
  menu which allows you to increment or decrement the
  register, or change the contents  by selecting "New
  Register Value...".  Each of the flags can be toggled
  via a right mouse click.

Memory dump window(s)
- Multiple memory dump windows can be active at the same
  time.
- More than 128 bytes can be dumped at once. The dump
  region automatically grows or shrinks as the window
  size changes.
- The Dump at Address dialog box (found under
  Inspect | Dump at Address...) is sensitive to the type
  of input entered into it.  A 16-bit logical address is
  entered as a four digit hex number with an optional
  leading 0x.  A 20-bit physical address is entered as a
  5 digit hex number with an optional leading 0x.
  An xpc:offset style address is entered as a 6 digit hex
  number with a ':' separating the xpc portion from the
  offset portion.
- The Data space and code space radio buttons are only
  visible if the compiler options have been set to enable
  separate instruction and data spaces.
- As the mouse moves over the memory dump window, the byte
  under the cursor preceded by its address is displayed
  in the window caption bar and in a flyover hint. Both of
  these options can be enabled and disabled independently.
- The memory dump window is capable of displaying three
  different types of dumps.  A dump of a logical address
  will result in a 64k scrollable region (0x0000 - 0xffff).
  A dump of a physical address will result in a dump of a
  1M region (0x00000 - 0xfffff).  A dump of an xpc:offset
  address will result in either a 4k, 64k, or 1M dump range
  depending on the option set on the debug windows tab under
  Options | Environment Options.  If a 4k or 64k range is
  selected, the dump window will dump a 4k or 64k chunk of
  memory using the given xpc. If 'Full Range' is selected,
  the window will dump 00:0000 - ff:ffff.  To increment or
  decrement the xpc, use the '+' and '-' buttons located
  below and above the scroll bar. (These buttons are only
  visible for an xpc:offset dump where the range is either
  4k or 64k).
- Each window can be set to update or not update after every
  single step or program pause.
- A dump window can be updated via a right mouse click or
  the button on the windows toolbar.
- The dump window toolbar can be hidden.
- A highlighted selection can either be copied to the
  clipboard or saved to a file.

Watch window
- Watches can be deleted in any order.
- All watches can be deleted at once.
- Evaluation of a watch (without adding it to the watch
  list) has been separated out. Use the 'Evaluate expression'
  button for this functionality.

Toolbars
- By default Dynamic C 8 shows a set of toolbar buttons very
  similar to the 7.x releases. However, the buttons are now
  grouped together by function and separated into individual
  toolbars.  Each toolbar can be repositioned within the main
  control bar, or can be removed  and floated individually.
- The visibility of individual toolbars can be toggled through
  two different means. Right clicking anywhere on the toolbars,
  or choosing Options | Toolbars, will allow for turning on or
  off selected toolbars.
- All toolbars can be shown by right clicking on the toolbars
  and choosing "Show All Buttons" or by choosing
  Options | Toolbars | Show All Buttons.
- The visibility of all toolbars can be toggled by right
  clicking on the toolbars and choosing "View Menu Buttons",
  or by choosing Options | Toolbars | View Menu Buttons.
- All visible buttons can be placed on a single toolbar by
  right clicking on the toolbars and choosing "Consolidate
  visible buttons to one toolbar" or by choosing Options |
  Toolbars | Consolidate visible buttons to one toolbars.
- Toolbars can be customized by right clicking on the toolbars
  and choosing "Customize Button Groups...", or by choosing
  Options | Toolbars | Customize Button Groups....  This will
  bring  up a dialog box showing all available buttons. Any
  button can be dragged out of the dialog and placed onto
  any toolbar in any position.  The same button can appear in
  more than one place if desired.  A button can be removed
  from a toolbar by dragging it away from the toolbar
  and releasing the left mouse button.

Printing
- Printing options are located on the Print/Alerts tab of
  the Environment Options dialog box. These options control the
  options set via the Setup button on this page or via
  File | Print Options.
- A font different than the editor font can be used for printing
- Options include printing a header, footer, numbering pages,
  syntax printing, word wrap, and definable margins.

Other changes
- Reverse find - located on the edit menu, will find the next
  occurrence of the current search string in the opposite
  direction last set in the Find dialog.
- Go to execution point - located on the Inspect menu, will
  bring into focus the current execution point when in debug
  mode.
- Save all - located on the File menu, will save the contents
  of all open editors.
- Compile mode
- Default project source file - located in
  Project Options | Compiler | Advanced Compiler Options,
  will compile the specified source file whenever the F5 or F9
  button is pressed.  If the specified source file is not open,
  it will be opened.  If the specified source file cannot be
  found, an error will occur.  Using this option will allow
  any source file to be focused when a compile is  started.
- Alerts - located in Environment Options | Print / Alerts, will
  cause Dynamic C to flash its icon on the taskbar after a
  successful compile and download if Dynamic C is not the active
  application, beep after a successful compile and download if
  Dynamic C is not the active application, and check the
  contents of open editor windows and prompt if the contents of
  any open files have been modified by an external source.

NEW FEATURES - Compiler
- Assembly list file generation - Located in Project
  Options | Compiler, a list file will be generated (with the
  extension .LST) in the same directory as the program source.
  The list file consists of a complete disassembly of all the
  code that was compiled with the program, including library
  code (a separate list file is generated for the BIOS and its
  associated libraries). The disassembly also includes intermixed
  source lines, with source file and line information.
- #zimport compression - A special form of #ximport, #zimport
  executes an external compression utility to compress input
  files at compile time, before download. Support libraries allow
  for  compressed files to be decompressed on-the-fly. See the
  \samples\zimport sample programs for  more information.
- Inline builtin internal I/O functions - Located in
  Project Options | Compiler, when the box is checked, builtin
  I/O functions (WrPortI, RdPortI, BitWrPortI, BitRdPortI) will
  be inlined if all arguments are constant.
- __lcall__ function prefix. When used in a function definition,
  the __lcall__ function prefix forces long call and return
  (lcall and lret) instructions to be generated for that
  function, even if the function is in root. This allows root
  functions to be able to be safely called from xmem. __lcall__
  has no effect on xmem functions, and use with cofunctions is
  prohibited.
- Mapfiles now include #ximport (and #zimport) information in the
  global/static data section.
- #pragma nowarn - Two forms are allowed that turn off either
  just trivial (warnt) or all (warns) warnings, depending on an
  option passed to the pragma. '#pragma nowarn [warnt/warns]'
  ignores warnings for the next physical line of code only.
  '#pragma nowarn [warnt/warns] start' ignores warnings until the
  '#pragma nowarn end' is encountered. The warnt/warns option
  is not required; if left off, default behavior is warnt.
- Compiler now defaults to storage class auto.

NEW FEATURES - Other
- HTTP.LIB now supports digest authentication.  Digest
  authentication can be enabled by setting
  USE_HTTP_DIGEST_AUTHENTICATION to 1. See the manual
  for more information.
- Feature Request #335 implemented:  You can now have multiple
  users per web page by setting SSPEC_USERSPERRESOURCE and
  using sspec_adduser() and sspec_removeuser().
- FTP_SERVER.LIB can now act as a full FTP server with the
  default handler functions.  Define the macro
  FTP_USE_FS2_HANDLERS to enable this feature.  The macros
  FTP_USERBLOCK_OFFSET and FTP_CREATE_MASK and the functions
  ftp_save_filenames() and ftp_load_filenames() also control
  this functionality.
- HTTP.LIB supports compressed files.  Support is enabled
  automatically if you #use zimport.lib before you #use http.lib.
  #zimported files are automatically detected when referenced in
  the http_flashspec array.  Compressed files added through
  ZSERVER.LIB functions must have the server_mask ORed with
  SERVER_COMPRESSED.  The macro INPUT_COMPRESSION_BUFFERS must be
  at least as large as HTTP_MAXSERVERS.
- The dlm_tcp.c and dlp_tcp.c sample programs now support
  separate I&D space and also support single 512KB split-flash
  operation.

TCP/IP Bugs
- Defect #80820 fixed.  The ASIX packet driver was reading
  from the wrong I/O address in the packet driver.  This
  could cause the ASIX to come up in the wrong duplex or
  glitch port a.
- Defect #80826 fixed.  Random overwrite of memory when DHCP
  packet received.
- Defect #80829 fixed.  SNMP trap messages being set to wrong
  MAC address.
- Defect #80837 fixed.  SMTP servers that send multiple 220
  greeting lines no longer cause the SMTP.LIB client to
  abort sending an email.
- Defect #80842 fixed.  Auto-negotiation is now properly done
  in ASIX.LIB.  This affects the RCM3200 and now allows
  full duplex mode to be negotiated.
- Defect #80843 fixed.  A problem that could potentially cause
  the reception of packets to stop working has been fixed in
  ASIX.LIB.
- Defect #80858 fixed.  SMSC.lib no longer enables the reception
  of all multicast datagrams in the SMSC chip.
- Defect #80859 fixed.  sock_init() on the Realtek no longer
  causes spurious memory writes into xmem or the stack.
- Defect #80861 fixed.  Buffer overflows in the test_cgi()
  function in samples\tcpip\http\cgi.c were fixed.
- Defect #80911 fixed.  sock_gets() will now always wait for a
  line-termination before returning data (as long as space is
  available in the user buffer).
- Defect #80912 fixed.  sock_bytesready() and sock_dataready()
  will always indicate the remaining data when the other side
  closes the connection, even when the last data was not
  line-terminated.
- Defect #80914 fixed.  Raw connections in VSERIAL.LIB now close
  correctly and allow later connections.
- Defect #80920 fixed.  Multi-byte reads with telnet_fastread()
  in VSERIAL.LIB are no longer garbled.
- Defect #80921 fixed.  pd_setup_RCM3200CORE() in ASIX.LIB now
  saves the IX register

Filesystem Bugs
- Defect #80827 fixed.  Filesystem corruption when shifting
  files to zero size after appending multiple of LS size
  bytes to file.
- Defect #80909 fixed.  A 2-flash (DLM, DLP or USE_2NDFLASH_CODE)
  program that uses FS2 in its first flash won't corrupt the code
  in the second flash.
- Defect #80910 fixed.  2-flash DLP using FS2 in its program
  flash can format/write file system in its non-"ID/User Blocks"
  area.

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #80399 fixed. Single stepping through pure assembly
  functions in library code now works correctly.
- Defect #80455 fixed. Bad stack handling with some
  integer expressions.
- Defect #80616 fixed. The illegal instruction "ld (hl+xx), a"
  now generates an error.
- Defect #80647 fixed. The address of operator (&) did not
  work properly with auto arrays.
- Defect #80652 fixed. An internal buffer limited function
  argument size. Function arguments may now be of unlimited
  size.
- Defect #80660 fixed. Unterminated conditional directives
  (#if, #ifdef, #ifndef, missing a #endif) now generate
  errors.
- Defect #80662 fixed. The GUI now checks for the existence of
  the BIOS before attempting to compile it (in all cases).
  Previously, if the BIOS was missing, Dynamic C could GPF.
- Defect #80690 fixed. Token checking was not suppressed when
  parsing character constants in assembly.
- Defect #80699 fixed. Cosmetic fix to invalid symbol name
  error message. Previously, invalid symbol names would not
  be included in the error message in some cases.
- Defect #80733 fixed. Using "..." as a parameter for indexed
  cofunctions now correctly generates an error.
- Defect #80735 fixed. Assembly macros containing single quotes
  occasionally failed with an incorrect error message.
- Defect #80758 fixed. C++ comments can now span multiple lines
  by using the "\" line continuation character.
- Defect #80761 fixed. The error message for defining a constant
  with #class auto enabled was confusing and incorrect. A new
  error message is now generated for this case.
- Defect #80775 fixed. Array dimensions that were too large were
  incorrectly allowed.
- Defect #80778 fixed. Actually a library bug. Using #useix
  caused the builtin functions BIT, SET, and RES to fail in
  certain circumstances.
- Defect #80782 fixed. Function pointers in xmem with an ximport
  caused watch expressions to occasionally crash the target.
  Improvements to target communication and the debugger in DC 8
  seem to have eliminated the problem.
- Defect #80785 fixed. The extended opcode for "LD HL, (mn)"
  no longer crashes the target when single-stepping.
- Defect #80798 fixed. Root bouncers were not generated for
  #asm xmem functions.
- Defect #80799 fixed. #asm functions could differ in memory
  mapping between the prototype and the definition. This could
  lead to a function marked as xmem in the protoype actually
  being compiled to root - with no warning.
- Defect #80800 fixed. The fix for defect 799 also fixed this
  defect. If the prototype of a #asm function has an "xmem"
  mapping prefix, and the definition is in a block with no
  mapping (default=root), an error is now generated.
- Defect #80803 fixed. Warnings in unrelated initializers can no
  longer prevent a watch expression from being added.
- Defect #80804 fixed. Macros matching register names now
  generate warnings.
- Defect #80811 fixed. The interrupt_vector keyword now works
  globally.
- Defect #80825 fixed. #ximport now works with relative paths
  rather than absolute.
- Defect #80830 fixed. Warning messages occasionally had strange
  line numbers that did not correspond to the program or the
  warning.
- Defect #80831 fixed. (1) Watch expressions for string literals
  now give the actual address of the literal (for strings in the
  program, does not work with constant initializers).
  (2) Function watch expressions now give the xmem address of the
  function, or its bouncer address (if the bouncer exists).
  (3) Errors in watch expressions do not break following valid
  expressions.
- Defect #80832 fixed. As part of the GUI overhaul, the
  information window now only displays info for root constants
  when separate I&D spaces is enabled (root constants do not
  exist in non-separate I&D mode).
- Defect #80835 fixed. The interrupt_vector keyword would
  generate the ISR jump instruction in user code (instead of the
  relay) under Separate I&D with #memmap xmem.
- Defect #80838 fixed. Cross-referential structures now compile.
- Defect #80839 fixed. Structs can now be declared and used to
  define pointers before the definition of the struct itself.
- Defect #80840 fixed. Aggregate member offset incorrect in asm
  code.
- Defect #80844 fixed. The modulus operator no longer allows
  floating point operands in any case.
- Defect #80845 fixed. Character constants are now correctly
  checked for improper octal values.
- Defect #80856 fixed. An off-by-one error in code origin
  checking did not allow code to completely fill an origin.
- Defect #80857 fixed. #xcodorg addresses are now checked and
  converted to xmem range addresses, with a warning. Previously
  this conversion was not done, and improper addresses could
  result in confusing error messages.
- Defect #80862 fixed. A bug related to origin follows handling
  could cause root code to be compiled, but not transmitted to
  the target.
- Defect #80868 fixed. Errors in watch expressions could cause
  the target to crash when a valid expression was entered later.
- Defect #80876 fixed. The compiler will now generate errors if
  #class is compiled with bad, missing, or extra arguments.
- Defect #80878 fixed. Actually a bug with the zcompress.exe
  utility, #zimport would fail if the directory the import file
  (and the program) was in contained spaces in its name. This was
  because the utility did not handle these spaces correctly.
- Defect #80901 fixed. Unnecessary nops generated for parameter
  passing.

Library Bugs
- Defect #80006 fixed.  Run-time math exceptions in watch
  expressions no longer cause target to crash.
- Defect #80721 fixed. HDLCopenX now returns correct value
- Defect #80819 fixed. useClockDivider3000's CLKDIV_8 macro value
  now affects CPU and peripheral clocks equally, consistent with
  other CLKDIV_x macro values.
- Defect #80824 fixed. RFU can load USE_2NDFLASH_CODE program BIN
  file that crosses ID/User Blocks at the top of primary flash.
- Defect #80841 fixed. Pilot BIOS protects appropriate size of
  ID/User Blocks for both mirrored and non-mirrored versions.
- Defect #80846 fixed. Error logging was broken in Compile to
  Flash, Run in RAM, non-Separate I&D mode.
- Defect #80850 fixed. LP35xx.lib. Modified sequence of
  configurations when switching between main oscillator and 32khz
  oscillator in powerMode(). C code converted into assembly code.
- Defect #80851 fixed. Much improved keyboard response when STDIO
  redirected to serial port A.
- Defect #80852 fixed.  The con_put() command in ZConsole.lib
  will now work with files larger than CON_BUF_SIZE (1024
  by default).
- Defect #80854 fixed. Target sometimes gets watchdog reset when
  switching from 32 KHz oscillator to main oscillator.
  LP35xx.lib powerMode() revised to match and useMainOsc()
  removed from brdInit().
- Defect #80855 fixed. The con_createv() command in ZConsole.lib
  now creates INT32 type variables correctly.  Previously, it
  used the value as the format specifier, so that the variable
  always displayed with the original value, even if changed.
- Defect #80864 fixed. Writing to the User Block on supported
  large and/or nonuniform flash types works correctly. NB: The
  user is cautioned that a single  sector erase on these types of
  flash may take up to two seconds, during which time no
  interrupts can be serviced!
- Defect #80874 fixed. LP35xx.lib. Corrected calibration start
  addresses for differential and milli-amp inputs.
- Defect #80875 fixed. RCM34xx.lib. Corrected calibration start
  addresses for differential and milli-amp inputs.
- Defect #80886 fixed. Applications which are compiled to and run
  in RAM and use separate I&D space can map in and write to
  flash.
- Defect #80890 fixed. Assembly level single stepping over a
  relative jump in the e000-e0ff range resulted in bad jump.
- Defect #80891 fixed. Assembly level single stepping over a
  relative jump no longer trashes the af' register.
- Defect #80903 fixed.  INTVEC_BASE and XINTVEC_BASE are now
  correctly located in FAST_RAM_COMPILE mode, with or without
  separate I&D space.
- Defect #80908 fixed.  Debug kernel no longer causes stack
  leakage when single stepping through a ucos program compiled
  for separate I&D.

Gui Bugs
- Defect #80021 fixed. The task bar no longer fails to come up
  after a print preview when Dynamic C is in full screen mode.
- Defect #80238 fixed. The preview text is no longer affected by
  invoking and accepting the Properties dialog from the Printer
  icon within Print Preview.
- Defect #80306 fixed. The cursor no longer moves when using the
  horizontal scroll buttons.
- Defect #80620 fixed. Setting a breakpoint in a pure assembly
  function no longer causes another window to pop/open up.
- Defect #80673 fixed. Memory dumps to text file is now correct
  for large amounts of memory.
- Defect #80689 fixed. Disassembly window now correct for
  00:e000-00:ffff address range.
- Defect #80772 fixed. Dumping entire flash from Inspect |
  Dump at Address now works correctly.
- Defect #80780 fixed. The Defines window in the Project Options
  dialog accepts multi-line entries that do not word-wrap,
  including pastes.
- Defect #80853 fixed. Ctrl+F2 correctly restarts a program being
  debugged via a RabbitLink without loss of communication.
- Defect #80860 fixed. The Assembly window now treats the n
  offset in (sp+n)-style instructions properly, as an unsigned
  value.
- Defect #80866 fixed. Gui "Include RST 28 Instructions" and
  compiler "DEBUG_RST" macro now synchronized properly.


Other Functional Changes
- Changed TCP/IP target communications to use the
  sock_xfastread/write functions to improve performance.
- Commented out unsupported hybrid word/byte mode flash types in
  FLASHWR.LIB and in FLASH.INI which were originally added in
  error.
- The User Block maximum size limit on supported flash types has
  been increased to 64KB. NB: The actual size of a User Block on
  supported large/nonuniform sector flash types is determined by
  the sector map of the particular flash device.
- Compiling via F5 or F9 may not display BIOS warning messages.
  Use Ctrl-Y to check if warnings are generated during the BIOS
  compile.

Known Problems
- Some computers may have trouble displaying the I/O register
  help file (Registers.chm) and/or the main Dynamic C help file
  (dcw.hlp).  Please contact Rabbit Tech Support for the files
  needed to update your system.

  OP7200 added.
- Separate I&D space uses memory that was previously reserved
  for xmem code and data, so when compiling in RAM only mode,
  some programs may not fit anymore.  Moving code and data back
  to root may help the programs fit again.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #658 fixed. Assignment to a constant pointer produced
  an error, even when correctly assigning to a dereferenced
  constant pointer.
- Defect #668 fixed. Local #asm labels that collide with global
  labels now generate an error. Previously, any references to
  the local label would silently resolve to the global label.
- Defect #716 fixed. @pc was not evaluated correctly.  @pc now
  evaluates to address of currently executing instruction.

  now work for the telnet I/O method.
- Defect #788 fixed. Changing PD0 before sock_init may
  cause the Ethernet not to initialize properly.

*****************************************************************

VERSION 7.30

NEW FEATURES
- Supports separate instruction and data space.
- http_scanpost function added to make it easier to handle
  http posts in cgi's.
- added the makecold function to create custom tuple mode
  programs.
- Feature request #487 improved.  STDIO redirect to serial
  now handles input as well, and will automatically switch
  between outputting to the STDIO window in debug mode and
  the serial port in run mode.
- Breakpoints can now be set in ISRs.
- Ethernet packet driver support for SMSC LAN91C113 10/100.
- Ethernet packet driver support for ASIX AX88796 10/100.
- New TCP/IP library IGMP.LIB allows the use of multicasting,
  IGMPv1, and IGMPv2.
- New function writeUserBlockArray() allows writing data from
  scattered locations contiguously to the user block.
  readUserBlockArray() allows reading contiguous data from the
  user block into scattered destinations.
- New function WriteFlash2Array() allows writing data from
  scattered locations to a contiguous second flash region.
- ZCONSOLE.LIB now supports saving configuration to the user
  block.  Hence, it is no longer dependent on the file systems.
- ZCONSOLE.LIB supports more configuration options (including
  DHCP), as well as multi-interface support.
- Additional xmem-related functions in XMEM.LIB:
  _LIN2SEG : assembler macro to convert linear (20-bit) physical
    address to segmented form in XPC window (0xE000-0xEFFF).
  xmemchr() : version of strchr()
  paddrDS() and paddrSS() : restricted but more efficient
    versions of the general paddr() function.
  xstrlen() : version of strlen()
  xgetint(), xgetlong() : read word or longword values from xmem.
  xsetint(), xsetlong() : write word or longword values to xmem.
- New library RAND.LIB.  Contains random number generators and
  a means for generating initial "seed" values based on external
  events.  This library is a robust extension of the random
  number generators in MATH.LIB.
- New TCP/IP libraries SNMP.LIB and MIB.LIB.  Implements SNMP v1
  basic protocol (using UDP as transport machanism) plus a data-
  base for the MIB tree.
- TCP has RFC-compliant congestion avoidance algorithm.
- You can eliminate all TCP code (and/or UDP code) by defining
  macros (DISABLE_TCP/DISABLE_UDP).  This saves code space and
  download time in applications which do not require these
  protocols.
- TCP/IP supports multiple interfaces.  You can now have ethernet
  plus PPP at the same time.  Each interface may be initialized
  using macro definitions, and is fully configurable at run-time
  by calling the ifconfig() function.  ifconfig() is the
  replacement for the deprecated tcp_config() function, however
  tcp_config() is still supported for backwards compatibility.
- TCP and UDP sockets now have well-defined data handler
  callbacks.  The UDP handler allows you to create extremely
  efficient request/response type UDP servers.  The TCP handler
  allows the callback to peek at the incoming data stream
  (possibly modifying it in-place before the application sees
  it).
- New TCP socket functions sock_xfastwrite() and
  sock_xfastread().  These allow data transfer directly from/to
  extended memory.  Also sock_aread(), sock_axread(),
  sock_awrite() and sock_axwrite() allow "atomic" reading and
  writing to sockets.
- ARP handles ICMP redirect messages.
- TCP write performance improved (about double the transmit
  speed compared with previous release).  Read performance also
  slightly improved.
- New style of configuring the TCP/IP libraries.  This was
  necessitated by the additional complexity resulting from the
  multiple interface support.  The old style of configuration is
  supported for backwards compatibility.  The new style allows
  "set and forget" configurations, including the ability to
  create custom configurations which will not be overwritten by
  new releases of Dynamic C.  You direct each sample program to
  use a particular configuration by defining a single macro
  (#define TCPCONFIG <config-number>).
- BOOTP/DHCP allocates its own UDP socket buffer.  No need to
  account for this in MAX_UDP_SOCKET_BUFFERS.
- BOOTP.LIB can be forced to use only BOOTP (not DHCP) if symbol
  BOOTP_ONLY is defined.

Other Functional Changes
- A macro has been added to the BIOS, USE_TIMERA_PRESCALE,
  to enable the timer A prescale available on the Rabbit 3000.
  Enabling this feature will run the peripheral clock directly
  off the CPU clock instead of the default CPU clock/2, allowing
  higher baud rates.
- The crystal frequency detection is now done in the BIOS
  as well (instead of just at compile time).  This means that
  things like baud rates will work properly when a binary
  image from a board with one crystal frequency is loaded
  onto a board with a different crystal frequency.  Works also
  with the download secondary programs.
- Dynamic C now polls the target only when it is explicity
  told to.  Polling remains enabled until explicilty disabled
  (via "Run | Poll Target" or Ctrl + O).
- FTP server keeps a single copy of the handler functions,
  instead of a copy for each session.  This means a handler
  function can call another function (since "state" ptr isn't
  needed to find the handlers).  Improvement: ftp_dflt_list() now
  calls the "get size" handler for each file.
- Improved the speed of the HTTP server sending static ximported
  files by replacing root copy with a sock_xfastwrite.
- Modified enableIObus() and disableIObus() so that they do not
  use save variables of shadow registers.  This allows the
  functions to be independent of each other.
- RCM3000, RCM3100, RCM3200 samples libraries are now #use'd with
  lcd122key7.lib.  This will produce an error message if
  PORTA_AUX_IO is not defined.
- LCD_Keypad sample programs have been updated to use dispInit()
  in place of glInit() and keyInit().  dispLedOut() replaces
  ledOut().
- Smart Star milli-Amp function descriptions and samples modified
  to accommodate factory calibrations in unit amperes.

  files.

Library Bugs
- Defect #182 fixed.  It was possible for read_rtc() to read the
  RTC while it was updating, occasionally causing invalid data.
  (Previously incorrectly listed as being fixed in VERSION
  7.02P.)  Note that read_rtc_32kHz(), added in 7.02P to allow
  access to the RTC while running off the 32kHz oscillator, is
  now deprecated.  Use read_rtc() instead.

  no longer abort before the data connection has a chance to
  establish.
- Defect #759.  The PE1-7 Function registers were being set
  instead of clearing PE0 function register for the BL2000 packet
  driver.
- Defect #762 fixed . serEopen would not set low baud rate
  prescaler correctly.
- Defect #765.  The pilot BIOS would erase the entire contents of

- Defect #771 fixed. uC/OS-II event flags now work properly for
  tasks with different stack semgents.
- Defect #781 fixed.  The bottom block in mirrored (v. 3 and up)
  ID/User Block systems is fully protected, and FS2 no longer
  attempts to write there.

VERSION 7.25SE2

NEW FEATURES
- Samples, libraries, and documentation for new
  RCM3100 core module added.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.25P

NEW FEATURES

- Samples, libraries, and documentation for new
  RCM3000 core module added.
- Feature request #380.  The clock doubler setting will
  now be optimized for the particular CPU clock detected
  instead of simply selecting a default value.
- Feature request #487.  STDIO output can now be
  directed to a serial port for debugging under run mode.
- The baud rate used for downloading is now negotiated
  between the PC and the target.  This will speed up
  downloading for various boards, particuarly if a USB
  converter is used where rates up to 460800 baud are possible.
- The baud rates for debugging with the BIOS have been
  expanded from 57600 and 115200 to 9600, 19200, 38400,
  57600, and 115200.  This aids in debugging with boards
  with slower crystals.
- Dynamic C now works with a wider selection of USB to Serial
  converters.  The quality of drivers for converters varies
  widely, and Dynamic C attempts to compensate for these
  differences.
- http_idle function added.  This function returns non-zero
  if all of the http_handler functions are not handling
  active connections.
- Support was added for more large-sector flash products.
- Alt+F7 and Alt+F8 will force the debugger to step by c
  statements rather than by instruction when the assembly
  window is open. (Introduced in 7.10).
- *.MAP files added to File Open dialog box.
- Single-stepping control improved in uC/OS-II. Can now
  confine stepping to current task.
- Callback function for ICMP echo requests (PING) can be
  defined.  See documentation in ICMP.LIB for the macros
  ICMP_ECHOREQ_CALLBACK and ICMP_RESPOND_TO_BCAST_ECHOREQ.

Other Functional Changes

- Removed initial bios compile. Bios will automatically compile
  the first time a program is compiled.
- Scrolling functionality improved for STDIO window.
- New "Tips of the Day" added.
- Overall compiler speed improved.
- Debugger runs programs full speed after 1 or more set
  breakpoints have been removed, either by toggling each
  breakpoint off or by using the Run|Clear All Breakpoints
  command.
- A "secondary program" can now read the System ID block stored
  at the top of the first Flash.  Required for TCP-based DLP, see
  "Samples\DOWN_LOAD\DLP_2_FLASH.c" for example.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #619 fixed. Multi-line assembly macros with arguments
  now compile if alternate registers are used in the replacement
  list.
- Defect #651 fixed. Removed superfluous warning when root
  functions are called via a long call.
- Defect #653 fixed. Pressing cancel when downloading the pilot
  bios during a compile invoked by either F5 or F9 will no longer
  cause occasional crashes.
- Defect #654 fixed. The command line compiler now reads the
  crystal frequency correctly when an RTI file is used with the
  -rf switch.
- Defect #655 fixed. The first parameter in an indirect call to
  an xmem function was being corrupted by the root bouncer code.
- Defect #656 fixed. Cofunctions in xmem using an everytime
  statement did not work correctly. All everytime statements are
  now placed in root space to avoid this.

GUI/Debugger Bugs
- Defect #649 fixed. CPU usage now drops to normal after a
  function lookup dialog is closed.
- Defect #672 fixed. Print dialog page range corrected for STDIO
  window.
- Defect #675 fixed. Macro definitions added to Defines window
  and then were causing Dynamic C to crash on the first compile.

Library Bugs
- Defect #605 fixed. TCP SYN queue fix to prevent occasional
  timeouts.
- Defect #607 fixed. TCP connections do not lock up if socket
  buffer size is less than the MSS.
- Defect #608 fixed. Incoming UDP packets do not alter flags in
  ARP cache.  Prevents ARP resolve failures after long intervals
  of inactivity.
- Defect #609 fixed. DHCP renew/rebind transmit loop fixed.
- Defect #640 fixed. serMode() now returns the correct status
  when the serial ports have been successfully configured.
- Defect #667 fixed. Telnet code in VSERIAL.LIB works properly
  with the Win2K and WinXP telnet.
- Defect #669 fixed. Error generated when attempting to compile
  code containing calls to randg() and randb().
- Defect #670 fixed. i2c_wr_wait() correctly returns -1 after too
  many retries.
- Defect #676 fixed. The clockDoublerOn/Off functions are
  supposed to keep target communications when called for most
  products, but target communications was consistently lost.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.21P

NEW FEATURES

- Xmem code can now be compiled into the bios.  Root code
  and data usage by libraries and BIOS reduced.

BUG FIXES

Compiler Bugs
- Defect #634 fixed. An improper check was occurring in
  evaluating a function's return value when returning a char.
  This bug was caused by the fix to defect #532, so the fix
  was removed until a better one is implemented and #532
  is now unfixed.
- Defect #635 fixed. Using sizeof on a constant string literal
  incorrectly resulted in an error.
- Defect #636 fixed. Char arrays assigned a string the same
  length as the array dimension produced errors
  when only a warning should have been produced.
- Defect #641 fixed. Null terminator was omitted from strings
  in xdata statements.
- Defect #643 fixed. Targetlesscomp.dll now has the correct base
  frequencies for the RCM2000, RCM2010, RCM2020, and SR9100.

  when "#pragma DATAWAITSUSED on" was applied.
- Defect #648 fixed. Cofunction abondonment in xmem broke
  when abondonment code appeared after the xmem page change.
- Defect #665 fixed. More than about 256 variables could not
  be declared in a single statement in global scope.

Library Bugs
- Defect #638 fixed. writeUserBlock() now works when #class
  auto is used.
- Defect #642 fixed. The debug kernel does not allow virtual
  watchdogs to be counted while single stepping.
- Defect #645 fixed. SHort delay added to the end of ModemInit()
  and CofModemInit() to prevent modem lockups on some hardware.

Documentation Additions
- Tech Note 219 - Root memory usage reduction tips added.
- Added uC/OS-II documentation from Jean J. Labrosse in the
  samples/ucos-ii directory. Newv251.pdf contains all of the
  features added since V2.00, and Relv251.pdf contains release
  notes for version 2.51. Several API changes have been
  introduced in v 2.51.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.20P

NEW FEATURES
- SR9150/SR9160 libraries added for full support of
  SR9150 and SR9160 specific functionality. This
  includes libraries supporting IO, RS232,RS485, TCPIP
  and SR9150/SR9160 hardware specific functions.
- Support has been improved for flash devices with 4096-byte
  sectors (i.e. the SST39 series).  In addition, support for
  compiling to "large-sector" devices (sector sizes > 4kb) has
  been added. See the Rabbit Designers Handbook for a list of
  supported devices.
- Feature Request #480. The enum keyword is now supported per the
  ANSI C specification.
- ucos2.lib has been upgraded to version 2.51 which includes
  mutexes and event flags.  The library has been broken up into
  multiple files to more closely match the source structure of
  uCOS-II.
- Feature Request #473. Added the built in macros __FILE__,
  __LINE__, __DATE__, and __TIME__. Refers to section 6.8.8 of
  the ANSI standard.  The difference between our implementation
  is that the __TIME__ and __DATE__ of the modules reflect either
  the time of compilation for the bios or the .c file.  The
  reason for this is that we lack linking, so libraries are
  essentially compiled at the same time as the file being
  compiled (ie the bios, or the users program).
- Sample program to interface to ADS787 chip added in
  /SAMPLES/SPI.
- Cloning is now all "fast" cloning, and options have been added
  for "sterile" clones, unconditional copy of a second flash, and
  more.  See RabbitBios.c for details.
- Added console_enable and console_disable to Zconsole, which
  allow the sharing of the connection.
- Added ConsoleLogin structure which will prompt for a name and
  password when a connection is established.  There is a matching
  CONSOLE_LOGIN_BACKUP macro for saving and restoring the
  structure.
- Efficiency and robustness improvements to FTP.
- FTP_CLIENT and FTP_SERVER libraries updated to support passive
  mode connections.  This makes it more convenient for clients
  and servers which are on different sides of a firewall.
- FTP_CLIENT supports upload/download of more than 32k using a
  user-specified data handler function.  The data handler can
  also generate dynamic content, or parse incoming content
  on-the-fly.
- Both FTP_CLIENT and FTP_SERVER libraries can co-exist in the
  one application.
- The default FTP server allows files owned by the anonymous user
  to be accessed by any other defined user.  Only files which are
  accessible to the logged-in user are listed.  The userID of the
  anonymous user is set via the ftp_set_anonymous() function.
- The function names for the default FTP handlers in library
  TcpIp\FTP_SERVER.LIB have been changed.  They are forward
  declared in the "header" portion.  See
  "Samples\TcpIp\Http\GetFile.c".  Defining FTP_WRITABLE_FILES
  permits FTP client to upload.  This requires support from
  application.
- TARGETPROC_LOADER has been reworked to support the new
  coldloader and PilotBIOS. Ethernet loading should be seamlessly
  transparent to the target board and DynamicC.
- VSERIAL.LIB handles remote-echo over telnet properly. Programs
  that use this library will also have to #use "DCRTCP.LIB"
  directly now, instead of relying on VSERIAL.LIB to do it.
- ZCONSOLE.LIB now uses the telnet code from VSERIAL.LIB, so echo
  is handled properly.
- Added SERA_USEPORTD macro to RS232 library. Allows alternate
  pins to be used for serial port A.
- Constant string optimization implemented.
- The Communications Options dialog now contains a checkbox to
  enable/disable processor verification. The default is checked
  (verify the processor with the DSR line) and the state is
  maintained per project.  This replaces the Tx Mode options
  which are no longer used.

Other Functional Changes

  Improvements to Smart Star library
- Added run-time error checking to functions.
- Added display/keypad module configurations.
- Added ledOut() function to library.
- Added serMode(3) configuration to support both 5-wire
  and RS485.
- Added end-of-conversion timeout to anaIn() function.
- Added return value: -3, eeprom unreadable, to
  anaInEERd() and anaOutEERd() functions.
- Modified AD/DA samples to demonstrate above eeprom
  error message.

- Structs and unions now obey the same scoping rules as other
  identifiers.  That is, a structure or union type defined in a
  function no longer has global scope.
- Feature Request #477. Stdio window row capacity increased from
  150 to 10000, with row and column limits maintained in the
  registry.
- #asm blocks are now marked "nodebug" by default, even if an
  enclosing function is marked "debug". This means that a
  breakpoint can not be set inside a #asm block unless "#asm
  debug" is explicitly used.
- Call graph in map file now suppresses subtrees of functions
  that have already been printed.
- Compiling with "Used Attached Target" no longer compiles the
  bios, and requires that the target has a running bios/program.
  The Options menu now has a Define Target Configuration Command.
  The Compile to *.bin file command now use the target
  configuration defined in the new option to compile, instead of
  popping the Target Configuration Dialog up for every
  compilation.

  watch expressions are added.
- Defect #564 fixed. A font change can now be cancelled after
  selecting a new font.
- Defect #596 fixed. When compiling, the Compile button is now
  inactive until compilation is completed. Hitting the Compile

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.06P2

BUG FIXES

Sample Program Bugs
- Defect #583 fixed. Printf statements in the sample program
  xstring.c are accurate.

File System Bugs
- Defect #548 fixed. FS2_RAM_RESERVE is no longer counted twice
  in the reserved RAM.
- Defect #592 fixed. FS2_RAM_RESERVE definition in
  RABBITBIOS.C is now in terms of 4096-byte blocks rather
  than byte count. This allows use of more than 32k for
  the RAM filesystem without getting warnings when
  compiling the BIOS.

Library Bugs
- Defect #445 fixed. In Ucos-II, task can now be deleted if
  it is created with OSTaskCreate.

  addresses.  These address were problematic for new controllers
- Defect #611 fixed. BL2100 digital port strobe changed from a
  chip select to a qualified RD & WR I/O strobe to eliminate
  an inadvertent channel selection.

TCP/IP Bugs
- Defect #409 fixed. TCP not sending correct keepalive segments.
- Defect #411 fixed. TCP timeout/retransmit strategy not
  implemented correctly.
- Defect #412 fixed. TCP not handling dropped or out-of-order
  segments correctly.
- Defect #413 fixed. TCP not handling closed window properly.
- Defect #465 fixed. sock_bytesready() and sock_dataready()

  sockets.
- Defect #471 fixed. After a connection was SYN queued,
  a re-transmit of the initial opening of the window does
  not have the proper flags set.
- Defect #473 fixed. Specifying the remote IP address
  and remote port in tcp_listen() and tcp_extlisten()
  now works correctly.
- Defect #474 fixed. DHCP did not accept packets <250
  bytes. It now rejects a packet if it is <240.
- Defect #480 fixed. SMTP.LIB and FTP_CLIENT.LIB
  were relying on MY_IP_ADDRESS directly, and now
  use the proper API call to catch runtime address changes.
- Defect #483 fixed. resolve_cancel(0) no longer makes
  subsequent DNS resolves fail.
- Defect #490 fixed. The HTTP server now properly
  ends 401 responses (in particular, the Opera browser
  now works with HTTP.LIBs authentication).
- Defect #502 fixed. A UDP socket will no longer receive
  broadcast data sent to a different port from the one
  on which it is listening.
- Defect #503 fixed. HTTP.LIB no longer misreports a
  Content-Length field from a client of over 32768 bytes.

  NET.LIB have been renamed to ETH_BUFSIZE and ETH_MAXBUFS.
- Defect #535 fixed. Using the resolve functions in DNS.LIB
  without a nameserver defined no longer causes a divide-by-
  zero error.  In conjunction with this fix, some error
  return values for the resolve functions have been changed
  (see below).
- Defect #562 fixed. Ethernet frames of larger than
  ETH_MTU are no longer accepted by the packet driver.
  This caused a potential crash problem in ICMP.LIB.
- Defect #566 fixed. Echo request packets now generated
  correctly. Also, echo requests are no longer lost
  when using PPPoE
- Defect #569 fixed. In ZCONSOLE.LIB, the subject line in
  a mail message was sometimes incorrectly treated as the
  first line in the body.
- Defect #593 fixed. Under heavy load specific sized
  packets could cause a lockup.
- Defect #605 fixed. HTTP server long delays when processing
  post-style form data.  Especially noticeable with MSIE
  browser.
- Defect #607 fixed. PPP buffer now allocated correctly
  after packet is dropped.

Changes to ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):

- These changes should be transparent to most applications
  except those that use UDP sockets.  A call to udp_open() or
  udp_extopen() used to block while waiting for ARP resolution.
  These calls are now non-blocking, so it is possible for the
  application to call udp_sendto() on a socket which is not
  resolved.  This will cause the datagram to be dropped.  To
  help old applications, two new UDP functions are provided:
  udp_waitopen() and udp_waitsend().  These functions are
  identical to udp_extopen() and udp_sendto() respectively,
  except that an additional parameter specifies the maximum
  amount of time to block waiting for ARP resolution to
  complete.  A value of 100ms should be sufficient in most
  cases.
- ARP is now handled using a cache table in all cases.
  The table includes router and host information.  There is no
  blocking waiting for ARP when opening a TCP or UDP socket.
  ARP cache entries are automatically refreshed
  based on short or long timeouts.  ethernet address is no
  longer stored in the socket structure.
- New sock_resolved() function for testing whether a TCP or
  UDP socket is resolved to a valid hardware (ethernet)
  address.

General improvements to the TCP/IP library suite:

- TCP: The "functions" sock_wait_established(), sock_wait_data()
  and sock_wait_clsoed() are deprecated; do not use them in new
  code.  These are really macros that "goto sock_err" when
  trouble is noticed.  All sample program have had these removed
  and replaced with looping code that calls tcp_tick().  See the
  file "Samples/RCM2200/myecho.c" for an example.
- TCP correctly computes round-trip-time estimators, which is
  important for handling timeout/retransmit strategy.
- TCP protocol core rewritten.  Much better throughput
  over long latency and/or unreliable links.  Code efficiency
  improvements for lower processor overhead.  Better conformance
  to host requirements RFC.  Nagle algorithm performed correctly.
  Common sections of code factored out into functions since
  the old code was somewhat inconsistent.  TCP is believed to
  be much more reliable and less prone to odd "lock-ups".
- New APIs for setting TTL and TOS for TCP/UDP sockets.
  sock_set_ttl() and sock_set_tos().
- ICMP errors passed up to transport protocol layers via
  upcall functions.  TCP handles transparently to the
  application.  UDP allows the application to receive ICMP
  messages via the normal udp_recvfrom() interface.  Additional
  UDP socket mode flags to control ICMP processing.
- Socket error messages handled by number (not strings).  New
  API in NETERRNO.LIB for checking and printing errors e.g.
  sock_perror().  Up to two error codes may be queued to a
  socket.
- Debugging and verbosity defines have been rationalized.  The
  programmer can #define xxx_DEBUG and xxx_VERBOSE to control
  DC "nodebug" settings and debugging messages.  xxx is the
  library name e.g. TCP_VERBOSE for TCP.LIB.  Can also set
  DCRTCP_DEBUG and DCRTCP_VERBOSE to enable for all TCP/IP core
  libraries.
- Improved control over library constants via #defines.
- Packet driver time delays reduced.
- IP and transport layers drop malformed packets which used
  to get through (causing possible crashes and security
  problems).
- Minor UDP checksumming bug fixed.
- TCP ignores unbelievable RST segments.
- DHCP client sets broadcast flag correctly, and understands more
  information from the server.  Does not crash with host option.
  Accepts timezone information from server. New API:
  dhcp_get_timezone().
- Miscellaneous documentation clarifications for some of the
  API functions.  (Control-H function descriptions).
- Many of the polymorphic API functions now take void * for
  socket rather than "sock_type *".
- sock_mode() enhanced by addition of some macros to perform
  type-safe updates of single mode flags.
- New udp_peek() function for examining datagram information
  before actually removing the datagram from the UDP socket
  receive buffer.  This also returns more detail than
  udp_recvfrom(), including the incoming TOS and whether the
  datagram was directed to the broadcast address.
- In HTTP.LIB, calling the epilog function automatically in an
  abort condition after the prolog function has been called has
  now been changed. Now, the user must set the abort_notify field
  in the HttpState structure to 1 in the prolog function to
  indicate that the epilog function should be called on abort.
  As before, the cancel field in the HttpState structure will be
  set to 1 in such a situation. This functionality has been
  extended to CGI functions as well (see the New Features below).
- In HTTP.LIB, the abort_notify field in the HttpState structure
  can be set to 1 in a CGI function if the user wants the CGI
  function to be called one more time in case of a connection
  abort condition.  The cancel field in the HttpState structure
  will be set to 1 in such a situation.  This could be used to
  release resources that have been locked, for example.
- HTTP: Added HTTP_USERDATA_SIZE to extend make
  "HttpState.userdata[]".  This space is totally for user
  program.  Its cleared on each new connection.  If
  HTTP_USERDATA_SIZE is left undefined, this
  additional field of HttpState isnt included.  See
  "Samples/TargetProc/SLog-App.c" for usage. Documented in the
  TCP/IP Users Manual rev. C.
- For automatically generated forms in HTTP.LIB, the
  epilog function will now be called even if the connection
  is aborted (as long as the prolog function has been called
  first).  The "cancel" variable in the HttpState structure
  is 0 to indicate that the epilog function is being called
  normally, and 1 to indicate that it is being called in a
  cancel situation.
  Documented in the TCP/IP Users Manual rev. C.
- Added support for dotted decimal IP addresses in
  resolve_name_start.
- New error return code RESOLVE_NONAMESERVER has been
  added to resolve_name_start(), resolve_name_check(),
  and resolve_cancel() in DNS.LIB.  Also, the return codes
  -1 and -2 for resolve_name_start() have been given the
  symbolic names RESOLVE_NOENTRIES and RESOLVE_LONGHOSTNAME,
  respectively. Documented in the TCP/IP Users Manual, rev. C.
- Feature Request #442. Extended smtp_sendmailxmem
  to data larger than 32K.


NEW FEATURES
- OP6800 libraries added for full support of OP6800
  specific functionality. This includes libraries
  supporting IO, RS232,RS485, TCPIP and OP6800
  hardware specific functions.
- SF1000 libraries are now provided in all versions of Dynamic C
  including the TSE and SE versions.

  in a BeginHeader block were not correctly read when the
  function name was > 32 chars.
- Defect 461 fixed. Corrected division bug for unsigned
  constant powers of two which was caused by a call to
  c_divt instead of c_usr.
- Defect #485. Dynamic C crashes on some macros due to

  cause lockup.

GUI/Debugger Bugs
- Defect #515 fixed. The message window can now be closed
  without problem after compiling a program following one or
  more warnings generated from compiling the BIOS.
- Defect #516 fixed. Changes to the Lib directory in the Compiler
  Options dialog are now effective immediately.
- Defect #517 fixed. The Rabbit Field Utility now sizes dialog

Additional Documentation

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.05

NEW FEATURES
- Command line compiler released and documented in Dynamic C
  Users Manual.
- Compiling a program  into two flash chips has been made
  nearly seamless. #defining the macro USE_2NDFLASH_CODE is the
  only thing the user needs to do to make it work. Two extra bin
  files are generated when the program goes into two flash so
  that an EPROM burner can be used. A single large bin file
  is also generated for use with the Rabbit Field Utility and
  cloning.
- SPI library added along with a sample interfacing to a
  serial ADC chip. See \SAMPLES\SPI\.
- GPS library added along with a sample interfacing to a
  GPS receiver. See \SAMPLES\GPS\.
- New I2C library and sample. Allows Rabbit to act as a
  master for a Philips I2C bus. Documented in Application
  Note AN215.  See \SAMPLES\I2C\.
- Major changes have been made to the
  UDP socket API.  These changes will greatly improve the
  flexibility of our UDP implementation. They are
  documented in the Dynamic C TCP/IP Users Manual
- Instruction Set Reference item added to Help Menu.
- Error logging implemented and documented in Dynamic C
  Users Manual.
- A serial download manager sample program for boards with 2
  flash has been added in \SAMPLES\DOWN_LOAD\.
- New filesystem library (FS2.LIB and friends). FS2 documented
  in Dynamic C Users Manual.  It is mostly compatible with
  the current filesystem (FILESYSTEM.LIB) except for
  initialization.  FS2 provides the following enhancements:
  . Allows overwriting parts of an existing file.
  . Multiple extents ("partitions") may be defined.
  . Supports any combination of flash memory, battery-backed
    RAM, or user-defined devices with a flash-like interface.
  . Supports large- and small-sector flash memory.
  . Runtime error reporting improved by using symbols
    defined in ERRNO.LIB.  These codes are returned in the
    errno variable if a filesystem routine encounters an
    error.
  The original filesystem is still supported, however any
  enhancements will only be made to FS2.
- Runtime error reporting is now improved, adding the
  file and line at which the error occurred, unless
  nodebug was in effect in the source code for that line.
- Sample serial downloader for 2 flash board added,
- If a file generates errors, compilation now stops at the
  end of the file.
- Added packet drivers. These drivers allow for packet based
  serial communication using a variety of packet separation
  modes. Function description documented in Dynamic C Users
  Manual.
- BL2000 serves Java applet to control Analog output.
  Samples\BL2000\Applet\ has web page to deliver a Java
  applet (source in Applet\pages\AnalogApplet.java).
  Includes pre-compiled .class files, so you can just
  re-compile from Dynamic C, download and run!  Applet
  tested on NS Communicator 4.72 and MSIE 5.00.  See
  Samples\BL2000\Applet\README.txt for details.
- "Smart" BIOS Recompilation. Dynamic C now keeps a dependency
  list for the libraries included in the BIOS with #use.
  The BIOS is only recompiled when one of the libraries it is
  dependent upon is modified (or a library that one of those
  libraries #uses). Nested #use is also supported,
  but any #use in a library must be in a BeginHeader/EndHeader
  block.
- Fast cloning option added, see RabbitBIOS.c.
- Complete rewrite of the DNS subsystem.
- New functions sauth_getuserid(), sauth_setpassword(), and
  sauth_removeuser() in ZSERVER.LIB.  sauth_getuserid()
  gets the user id for a given username.  sauth_setpassword()
  sets the password for a given user id.  sauth_removeuser()
  removes the given user from the user list.  Note any web
  pages associated with that user should be reassigned to
  another user, or have authentication removed (by passing
  the parameter "" to sspec_setrealm()).
- New function http_urldecode() to HTTP.LIB. Converts
  a string with HTTP transfer-coding "tokens" (such as
  %20 (hex) for space) into actual values.  Changes "+"
   into a space.
- New function http_contentencode() to HTTP.LIB. Converts
  a string to include HTTP transfer-coding "tokens"
  (e.g. &#64; (decimal) for at-sign) where appropriate.
  Encodes these chars: "<>@%#&"
- New callback macro HTTP_CUSTOM_HEADERS in
  HTTP.LIB.  The developer  can define this macro to be a
  function of the following prototype:  void my_headers
  (HttpState* state, char* buffer, int bytes); The state
  parameter is a pointer to the state structure for the
  calling web server, the buffer parameter is the buffer
  in which the header(s) can be written, and bytes is the
  number of bytes available in the buffer. The macro will
  be called whenever HTTP headers are being sent.
  Collected all runtime error code into a single new library,
  ERRORS.LIB.  Also added three new runtime errors:
  "invalid cofunction instance", "unexpected interrupt",
  and "bad parameter passed to I/O function".
- New functions sspec_setpreformfunction() and
  sspec_getpreformfunction() in ZSERVER.LIB.  These
  functions add support for a user-supplied function that
  will be called just before HTML form generation.
- New function udp_send, which will send a datagram to the
   remote host on the UDP socket.
- New function udp_sendto, which will send a datagram to a
  specified remote host and port.
- New function udp_recv, which will receive a datagram from
  a remote host.
- New function udp_recvfrom, which will receive a datagram
  from a remote host, and also return the IP address and port
  number of the sender.
- New functions tcp_extopen, tcp_extlisten, and udp_extopen
  have been defined.  These allow a user to specify their
  own socket buffers in xmem (with xalloc) instead of having
  them allocated from the pool.  Hence, it is now possible for
  the user to handle socket buffer management.
- Added functions resolve_name_start(), resolve_name_check(),
  and resolve_cancel() to perform nonblocking DNS lookups.
- Added the following configuration macros for DNS:
  * DNS_MAX_RESOLVES (4 by default) -- number of
  concurrent DNS queries that can be done.  This specifies
  the size of an internal table that is allocated in xmem.
  * DNS_MAX_NAME (64 by default) -- hostnames to look up
  (including an appended default domain) must be no larger
  than this macro, including the null-terminator.  For
  temporary storage, a variable of this size must be placed
  on the stack in DNS processing.
  * DNS_MAX_DATAGRAM_SIZE (512 by default) --
  specifies the maximum length in bytes of a DNS datagram
  that can be sent or received.  A root data buffer of this
  size is allocated for DNS support.
  * DNS_RETRY_TIMEOUT (2000 by default) -- specifies
  the number of milliseconds to wait before retrying a
  DNS request.
  * DNS_NUMBER_RETRIES (2 by default) -- specifies the
  number of times a request will be retried after an error
  or a timeout.
  * DNS_MIN_KEEP_COMPLETED (10000 by default) --
  specifies the number of milliseconds a completed request
  will be kept in an internal table before it can be flushed,
  so that the user can retrieve the results.
  * DNS_SOCK_BUF_SIZE (1024 by default) -- specifies
  the size in bytes of the socket receive buffer for the
  DNS socket.  An xmem buffer of this size will be allocated.
  Compatibility has been preserved for the resolve() function,
  call the MAX_DOMAIN_LENGTH macro, and the
  DISABLE_DNS macro.
- The sizeof operator can be used inside assembly blocks.
  Documented in the Dynamic C Users Manual.
- ZCONSOLE.LIB now supports FS2.LIB.  The functions
  con_backup_bytes(), con_set_files_lx(), and
  con_set_backup_lx() have been created for use with FS2.LIB.
- All of the new and improved TCP/IP functionality has been
  documented in the Dynamic C TCP/IP Users Manual
- A new registry entry, Include Time Stamp, has been added under
  the Dynamic C Compiler Section. This setting is set to true
  by default, but can be edited so that Dynamic C will compile
  files without including time stamp information.
- Access to time/date stamp added:
  long dc_timestamp;
- Ability to #define macros in compiler options GUI added.
- Ability to select a different LIB.DIR file in compiler
  options GUI added.
- When a program is compiled for debug, the source file will
  no longer scroll to the beginning of the code when debug
  mode is entered.

  automatically up for the RCM21xx.  This would clobber any
  user interrupt vector that was set up before sock_init.
  It now only sets up a vector if PD_INTVEC is defined to
  the interrupt vector.
- Defect #426 fixed.  WriteFlash2() was assuming an ID block

Other Functional Changes
- Feature Request #260. Using a C long macro in an assembly
  block now produces a demotion-of-value warning.
- Feature Request #270. P flag is V in register window. V and
  nv are synonymous with lo and lz.
- Feature Request #325. Users can compile with or without
  debug information to the target after compiling to a
  file without debug information.
- Feature Request #332. The Rabbit Field Utility will now look
  for the cold loader and pilot BIOS in the current working
  directory if a pathname is not found in the registry.
- Feature Request #341. Error and warning messages are now
  shortened by replacing the full pathname with just the
  filename and extension.
- Feature Request #351. All error messagebox messages now stay
  on top of all other windows within Dynamic C.
- Feature Request #443. Added HTTP_PORT to make it easy to
  override the default port on a HTTP server.
- It is no longer necessary to change USE115KBAUD in the
  BIOS to change the baud rate between 115200 and 57600 ,
  an internal macro was defined.
- The initial load of the pilot BIOS has been sped up to
  57600 baud, resulting in a reduced BIOS load time.
- Symbol and literal string table size increased.
- filesystem: File access is faster due to lookup tables in RAM
  added fshift() for removing data from the beginning of
  a file  added fs_reserve_blocks() to reserve space that can
  only be allocated by privileged files (128-143) Documented in
  Dynamic C Users Manual.
- Dynamic C now always generates an even sized program to
  facilitate checksumming using word-wise methods.
- For uC/OS-II support, you should define the new macro
  MAX_SOCKET_LOCKS.  This defines the number of
  socket locks that will be allocated.  It defaults to
  MAX_TCP_SOCKET_BUFFERS + MAX_UDP_SOCKET_BUFFERS.
  This macro is necessary because we can no longer calculate
  the number of socket locks needed based on the number of
  socket buffers, now that the user can manage their own
  socket buffers.
- sock_bytesready and sock_dataready have been modified to
  work with the new UDP sockets.  They will return the size
  of the next datagram to be read if there is one waiting.
  sock_bytesready will return -1 if there is no datagram
  waiting. sock_dataready will return 0 if there is no datagram
  waiting--hence, sock_dataready can not distinguish between
  no datagram waiting and an empty datagram waiting.
- The functions sock_read, sock_write, sock_fastread,
  sock_fastwrite, sock_gets, sock_puts, sock_getc, sock_putc,
  and sock_preread no longer support UDP sockets.
- The functions sock_recv_init, sock_recv, and sock_recv_from
  have been removed
- UDP socket buffers are now circular, and can accept as many
  datagrams as will fit in the buffer
- TCP and UDP socket buffer management has been changed:
- The socket buffer pool has been split into separate TCP and
  UDP buffer pools
- The macro MAX_TCP_SOCKET_BUFFERS gives the
  number of TCP socket buffers that will be allocated.  It
  defaults to 4.
- The macro TCP_BUF_SIZE gives the size of a TCP socket
  buffer.  It is split into a read buffer and a write buffer of
  equal sizes. It defaults to 4096 bytes.
- The macro MAX_UDP_SOCKET_BUFFERS gives the number of UDP
  socket buffers that will be allocated. It defaults to 0.
- The macro UDP_BUF_SIZE gives the size of a UDP socket
  buffer.  It is all one read buffer, since UDP datagrams are
  sent out immediately.  It defaults to 4096 bytes.
- For backwards compatibility, MAX_TCP_SOCKET_BUFFERS
  will take on the value of MAX_SOCKETS if it is defined.
- For backwards compatibility, TCP_BUF_SIZE and UDP_BUF_SIZE
  will take on the value of SOCK_BUF_SIZE if it is defined.
- For backwards compatibility, TCP_BUF_SIZE and UDP_BUF_SIZE
  will take on twice the value of tcp_MaxBufSize if it is
  defined.
- The preprocessor symbol FS2_RAM_RESERVE may be defined in
  STACK.LIB in order to reserve a block of RAM for use by FS2.
- The maximum compilation errors and warnings can now be set in
  the dialog box shown with the Options | Compiler menu
  selection.
- Defining the label SERB_USEPORTD will cause serial
  port B to use its alternate rx/tx pins on parallel port D
- Additional error checking for module headers.  Specifically,
  errors are reported if BeginHeaders and EndHeaders
  do not match.
- Origin directives now support a follows specifier and a
  resume specifier to allow compiling around the system ID
  block kludgelessly. Documented in Designers Handbook
- Compile to bin file has an option for padding or not padding
  the file with zeros for program code that starts at
  addresses > 0.
- A Intel HEX file is now always generated for all compiles.
- Use HTTP_MAXNAME in "HttpType" structure instead of
  hardcoded constant 20 for field "type[]".  This allows
  MIME types of longer than 19 chars in the HttpType structure.
  Developer can override HTTP_MAXNAME in their source file.
- sock_puts now has error code (-1).  It can be generated if it
  is called with a UDP socket.
- sock_gets now has error code (-1).  It can be generated if it
  is called with a UDP socket.
- Made readUserBlock, writeUserBlock functions backward
  compatible with older or no system ID block.

Additional Documentation
- All new/improved TCP/IP functionality has been documented in
  the Dynamic C TCP/IP Users Manual.

- Dynamic C now supports the RCM2300 series including
  new samples and documentation.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.04P3

New Features
- Dynamic C Premier now supports the BL200 series
  as well as Smart Star D/A boards.
- Added packet drivers. These drivers allow for
  packet based serial communication using a
  variety of packet separation modes.

Bug Fixes
- Defect #387 fixed.  The packet driver for RCM2100
  did not use shadow registers properly.
- Defect #396 fixed. Time-outs in RS232.LIB did not
  handle MS_TIMER rollover correctly.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.04T2

New Features
- Samples, libraries, and documentation for new
  RCM2200 core module added.
- Slave port support functions added.
- A "user block" has been added to the flash device
  along with the ID block for protected storage of
  calibration constants, IP addresses, etc.  To
  support large-sectored flash, these two protected
  blocks take up 16KB at the top of flash.  If more
  code space is needed, the user block can be removed
  from boards that are not currently using it;
  contact Tech Support for more information.
- New library tftp.lib provides a TFTP client
- Improved DHCP support (including reacquiring leases
  and file transfer support)
- New library zconsole.lib implements a customizable
  serial console with or without TCP/IP functionality
  such as a web server and mail client
- New libraries for using the Rabbit slave port:
  slave_port.lib master_serial.lib, and sp_stream.lib
- New function smtp_sendmailxmem() in SMTP.LIB.  It
  works much like smtp_sendmail(), except that it
  gets the body of the message from an xmem buffer.
- TCP Keepalives are now available. See the function
  tcp_keepalive() to turn on keepalives on a
  per-socket basis.

Bug Fixes
- Defect #254 fixed.  spkrOut() was not included in
  ctrl-H function lookup.
- Defect #257 fixed.  The flash transfer buffer will
  now be located at the top of available RAM instead
  of in the middle.
- Defect #258 fixed.  The MAC address for the second
  interface on the EG2000 is now handled correctly.
- Defect #259 fixed.  The spkrOut() function now
  disables the timer B interrupt when volume is set
  to zero.
- Defect #274 fixed. The runtime error list has been
  cleaned up.
- Defect #275 fixed. PPP driver no longer requires
  compression options
- Defect #281 fixed.  Potential buffer overflow in
  DNS lookups has been corrected.
- Defect #296 fixed. PPPsetAuthenticator() now has
  correct description
- Defect #298 fixed.  Some packets were being
  unnecessarily broadcast when the destination
  combined with the netmask was FFFFFFFF.
- Defect #302 fixed. Function description blocks in
  modem.lib have correct library name
- Defect #315 fixed. A potential race condition in the
  Realtek initialization on TCP/IP Development Kits
  was removed.
- Defect #316 fixed. Added ModemSetDTR() call and port
  pin idle high to ModemInit() for more standardized
  modem initialization.
- Defect #318 fixed. sock_recv_from() now returns
  the IP address and port number in host byte order
  instead of network byte order.  Note that this does
  affect code that depends on the old behavior.
- Defect #327 fixed.  Cloning now works for CPU clock
  frequencies > 19MHz.
- Defect #328 fixed.  512kb flash device support was
  fixed.
- Defect #336 fixed. TCP/IP stack sent unnecessary
  ACKS when a connection  was actively opened, but
  no data has been sent.
- Defect #343 fixed.  Auto variables are no longer
  corrupted when certain transcendental functions are
  called from useix functions.
- Defect #344 fixed. Serial port A now sets parallel
  port C pin correctly.
- Defect #350 fixed.  Error reading ID on some Atmel
  flash fixed.
- Defect #352 fixed. xmem2root and root2xmem were not
  reentrant.  This caused problems using HTTP with
  MuC/OS.
- Defect #354 fixed.  RES and SET forced to root
- Defect #362 fixed.  tcp_reserveport() would only
  work the first time it  was called.
- Defect #363 fixed.  FFT problems with powerspectrum
  and fft_hann  when 256 or 512 data points used fixed.
- Defect #365 fixed.  RabbitLink wouldnt restore the
  modified TCP port on bootup.
- Defect #375 fixed.  All valid shadow registers are
  now initialized by the BIOS.
- Defect #383 fixed.  TargetlessComp GUI boards list
  now contains all Rabbit boards. New board will be
  added upon compiler upgrade, while retaining any
  previously configured boards.
- Defect #416 fixed.  The header for chkHardReset() has
  been corrected.

Other Functional Changes
- The GOCR register is now initialized to A0h. This makes the
  CLK pin low, before it was driven by the crystal. This
  actually changed in 7.02, but was omitted in the release note.
- Cloning is set to NOT clone the whole flash by default now,
  just the user program and BIOS.
- DNS lookup behavior with default domains has changed
  slightly.  If the name to be looked up contains a ., then it
  is looked up directly first; if that fails, it is looked up
  with the default domain appended.  If the name to be looked up
  does not contain a ., then it is looked up with the default
  domain appended first; if that fails, it is looked up directly.


Additional Documentation
- Runtime error chapter in Dynamic C manual has been
  updated and expanded.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.04P

New features
- New library for AES(Rijndael) encryption
- New RCM2100 specific samples have been added along with
  Realtek and IP driver modifications for full RCM2100 support.
- Added the WriteFlash2() function, which will write a buffer
  to the second flash devices on boards with two flash installed
  (this function is NOT compatible with the flash file system).
- New sample to display memory usage.
- The allocation of memory quadrants was rearranged when
  compiling to flash:
    quadrant 0 (0x00000-0x3FFFF) is the primary flash
    quadrant 1 (0x40000-0x7FFFF) is the second flash (if
                                 installed)
    quadrant 2 (0x80000-0xBFFFF) is RAM
    quadrant 3 (0xC0000-0xFFFFF) is RAM
  Previous releases of Dynamic C would swap quadrant 3 between
  RAM and the second flash to write to the second flash.

Bug Fixes
- Defect #256 fixed.  The TBCSR and TBCR registers are
  now cleared in the BIOS, preventing odd behavior with
  some programs that used the timer B interrupt.
- Defect #278 fixed.  Dynamic C correctly reports errors concerning
  running out of xmem code space.
- Defect #280 fixed.  Dynamic C crashes when the same function
  names is used in a function description block in three or
  more libraries.
- Defect #283 fixed.  Cloning was broken in Dynamic C
  versions 7.02 and 7.03.
- Defect #288 fixed. ModemSetDTR() was incorrect in modem.lib
- Defect #289 fixed. RabbitLink no longer loses serial console
  communication with the target in normal run mode.
- Defect #290 fixed. GUI for defining targetless compile data
  will now accept international floating point separators and
  will automatically convert any existing registry targetless
  compile data to use the current symbol.
- Defect #293 fixed.  Dynamic C lost communication with the BIOS
  on boards running low-frequency crystals (e.g. 3MHz).
- Defect #307 fixed. Delays in cofunctions were not working.
- Defect #309 fixed.  Flash file system could cause inadvertent
  writes to Rabbit 2000 registers.
- Defect #330 fixed. fshift() could corrupt lookup tables
- Defect #346 fixed.  Conversion programming in fs_block_init
  in fs_flash.lib no longer causes a boundary check to fail.

Documentation Changes
- RCM2100 manual added

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.03P

New features
- The library zserver.lib now provides support for variables
  located in xmem.  sspec_addxmemvar() adds an xmem variable,
  and the macro SSPEC_XMEMVARLEN defines the size of the
  stack-allocated buffer that is used in sspec_readvariable()
  for xmem variables.  SSPEC_XMEMVARLEN is 20 by default.
- New function sspec_getvarkind() in zserver.lib returns the
  kind of variable represented (i.e., INT8, INT16, INT32,
  FLOAT32, or PTR16).
- New function sspec_getvartype() in zserver.lib returns the
  type of variable (i.e., SSPEC_XMEMVAR or SSPEC_ROOTVAR)
- Flash filesystem features: shifting out contents from the
  beginning of a file using fshift(), reserving blocks that
  will remain available for privileged files.

Bug Fixes
- Defect #248 fixed.  Mail sent through the SMTP client was not
  readable by some mail readers.
- Defect #265 fixed.  sock_bytesready() sometimes failed
  with ASCII TCP sockets.
- Defect #267 fixed. block checksums were being incorrectly
  modified

Other Functional Changes

Documentation Changes

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.02P3

Bug Fixes
- Defect #261 fixed.  WriteFlash() would write the data
  requested but trash the rest of the flash sector.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 7.02P

New features
- Libraries for dial-up PPP connections
- Dynamic C can now be used to program and debug over Ethernet
  and Internet.
- The Rabbit Field Utility can now load over Ethernet/Internet.
- Programs can now be compiled to a .bin file
  without an attached target.
- Calls to xmem functions no longer use a root proxy
  (i.e., "root bouncer"), but use the lcall instruction.
  This improves code size and speed.
- Protected and shared variables are now supported.
- More descriptive error messages can be displayed by
  pressing F1 when the message window is active.
- A good map file is now generated for compiled programs.
- The #class directive can be used to change the
  default storage class to auto/static.  In DC, the
  default is normally static.
- Users can now define their own runtime error handler
  instead of the default function using the
  defineErrorHandler() function.
- Sleepy mode is better supported:  periodic
  interrupts are disabled when the CPU is switched to
  the 32kHz oscillator and re enabled when switching
  back to the main oscillator.  In addition, a new
  function, updateTimers(), can be called while in
  sleepy mode to update TICK_TIMER, MS_TIMER, and
  SEC_TIMER which normally depend on the periodic
  interrupt.
- New functions strcmpi() and strncmpi() perform case-
  insensitive string compares
- New function Disable_HW_WDT() disables the hardware
  watchdog timer.
- Watch expression text control is now a combobox
- A Tip of the Day dialog will come up if its Show on startup
  checkbox is checked, or when the tip menu item in Help is
  clicked.
- New TCP/IP function, sock_bytesready(), provides
  functionality similar to sock_dataready(), except
  that it is more useful for ASCII mode sockets.
  To save memory, sock_dataready() should no longer be
  used, although it is provided for backward
  compatibility. Note that sock_bytesready() returns
  -1 for an empty socket, whereas sock_dataready()
  returns 0 for an empty socket.
- Compiler option for creating a .bin file
  with or without including the bios.
- New Watch Code radio buttons in Options/Compiler menu dialog
  box to enable any watch expressions or to restrict expressions
  to save space.
- New library zserver.lib (automatically included for the web
  and FTP servers) provides the basis for server object handling.
  It handles files (in both root and extended memory), variables,
  functions, forms, and users.  Files and users may now be
  directly shared between the web and FTP servers.  Server-
  specific notes follow:
  * HTTP Server
    http_flashspec may still be used for the web server.  Define
    HTTP_NO_FLASHSPEC if you do not wish to use the
    http_flashspec structure.
  * FTP Server
    The FTP server must use the new zserver.lib functionality.
    The FTP handler interface has changed.  One more function to
    handle directory listings has been added, and an offset
    parameter has been added to the read and write functions.
  See the TCP/IP High Level Protocols manual for more\
  information.
- The web server can now automatically generate and parse forms,
  which makes it much easier to modify variables through a web
  browser.  See the sample program form1.c and the TCP/IP High
  Level Protocols manual for more information.
- Added a new function paddr which converts a logical address
  into a physical address.
- Added smtp_setserver() to smtp.lib, which allows setting the
  SMTP server at runtime.
- bios/ramonlybios.c and bios/ramonlycoldload provided for custom
  boards having no flash with RAM connected to CS0/OE0/WE0
- A macro CS1_ALWAYS_ON was added to allow the BIOS to easily be
  changed to keep CS1 always active
- Added support for 12 new flash devices.
- A library for performing MD5 hashes, MD5.LIB, including a demo
  program, MD5_TEST.C

Bug Fixes

- Defect #45 fixed. strtol tailptr problem corrected.
- Defect #53 fixed.  Expressions to sizeof operator do not
  generate code unless they have a side effect (i.e., contain ++,
  --, or an assigment operator).  This feature is not portable,
  since no sizeof expressions are evaluated in ANSI C.
- Defect #74 fixed. Fixes bug with runwatch for auto variables.
- Defect #82 fixed. A warning is now issued if a library (.lib)
  or a source (.c) file line length exceeds maximum allowed
  (512).
- Defect #85 fixed.  Lcalls can be made with two arguments: the
  first being a constant, interpreted as the xpc, followed by
  either a label or a constant, interpreted as the logical
  address.  Lcalls can also be made with a label as the only
  argument.
- Defect #87 fixed. Dynamic C no longer crashes when attempting
  to compile to a write protected directory, but issues an error
  message instead.
- Defect #107 fixed.  Fixed a GPF that can occur if Dynamic C
  is opened on a com port that is already in use.
- Defect #112 fixed.  In HTTP.LIB, file lengths are now
  represented by long integers to allow images and
  SSI-included files > 32kb.
- Defect #113 fixed.
- Defect #114 fixed.  Not a bug.  Warning should not be generated
  as arithmetic character expressions are promoted to integer.
  Improved typechecking for constant data initializers.  Shown
  program should not compile.
- Defect #115 fixed. Fixed constant initializers to match
  ISO/ANSI specification.  Only constant literals or static
  storage addresses should be allowed in initializer expressions.
  Some complex expressions with addresses are unsupported.
- Defect #117 fixed.  Oversized single and multi-dimensional root
  data arrays compiled due to 16-bit overflow.  Root data arrays
  now limited to a total of 32,767 elements.
- Defect #119 fixed.  Com port used by Dynamic C is correctly
  initialized.
- Defect #120 fixed.  Function prolog/epilogs are generated
  inline if compiling optimized for speed, and are only used
  when optimizing for size if the function includes debug
  information, or if the function is nodebug and uses auto
  variables.
- Defect #123 fixed.  Programs with certain compile time errors
  caused the compiler to enter an endless loop.
- Defect #124 fixed.  Bug limits nesting of #if and #ifdefs
  to 3 or 4 levels.  New limit is 2048.

  directories nested to many levels, and can run programs with
  long path names.
- Defect #165 fixed. pktdrv.lib will mark buffers while it is
  using them. This will prevent future problems with multiple net
  drivers sharing TCP/IP buffers.
- Defect #172 fixed. Keyword checking on identifiers has been
  implemented.
- Defect #174 fixed. Improved documentation of serial receive
  functions.
- Defect #176 fixed. More checking is done on initializer lists.

  because of a ICMP Port Unreachable message.
- Defect #198 fixed. Bug with post inc/dec with type char.
- Defect #199 fixed. RS232.LIB function descriptions now
  documented as being non-reentrant.
- Defect #200 fixed. RS232.LIB functions separated into different
  headers to reduce code size.
- Defect #201 fixed. Floating point operators >, <, <=, and >=
  called the wrong comparison function when the compiler reorders
  the operands.
- Defect #202 fixed.  the xstring label points to the memory
  location after the table, which holds the address of the first
  table entry.
- Defect #204 fixed. The invalid instruction ld r, (hl+d) now
  produces an error.
- Defect #205 fixed. Interference between #ximport and comments.
- Defect #208 fixed. The assembler would not allow long jumps
  to forward references.
- Defect #209 fixed. All serial interrupts are explicitly
  disabled during BIOS startup. This should eliminate target
  communication errors.
- Defect #211 fixed. Register collision not detected when mixing
  long and int/char types in some expressions using the mod
  operator %.
- Defect #213 fixed. A potential problem with reading and writing
  Ethernet packets whose length is 14 bytes more than an even
  256 byte multiple.
- Defect #214 fixed. A missing #endif could cause the compiler
  to hang.
- Defect #215 fixed. A bug in the flash driver could prevent
  flash writes under special conditions.

  that contain data.
- Defect #240 fixed. #ximport works correctly in header sections
  now.
- Defect #241 fixed. An If-Modified-Since header caused the HTTP
  server to close the connection.
Other Functional Changes
- The error window now displays a maximum of 10 errors,
  10 serious warnings, and 10 trivial warnings.  Checks
  for warnings and errors are separate so that when one
  category is filled, messages from the other category
  can still be reported.
- The coldloader can now be up to 0x4000 bytes in length.
- Any IO (ioe, ioi) instruction that immediately precedes
  certain 1 byte instructions using hl to access memory
  are now followed by a nop to fix hardware bug with
  these instructions.
- sock_fastwrite() now refuses to send a UDP datagram that
  would need to be fragmented, instead of only sending out
  the first fragment
- Target communication errors are now more informative, stating
  the high level activity being executed when the error occurred
  as well as the read/write address if applicable.
- Default MTU size for IP packets is set to 600. This allows for
  smaller packet buffers
- DCRTCP supports SYN queing, where new connections can be
  accepted and maintained before an available socket is made
  ready.
- Floating point code moved to xmem to save root code space.
- Pointer checking code was moved to xmem
  and BIOS, start-up, and program code now immediately follow
  each other to conserve root memory space.
- Pointer checking initialization is now done at compile
  time.  Turning runtime pointer checking off will reduce the
  amount of root code space used by 256 bytes.
- The semantics of the keywords "xmem" and "root" apply to
  function prototypes.
- New limits.h file (that is automatically included) defines
  constants representing the limits of representable values
  for C variable types (such as INT_MAX and INT_MIN)
- The flash buffer has been moved from root memory to XMEM,
  freeing up 1024 bytes of root memory for user programs and
  variables.
- Ctrl-S shortcut key for save file added.

VERSION 6.57P1 / 6.57T1

Bug Fixes
-Defect #192 fixed. pd_resetinterface()--usually called

*****************************************************************
VERSION 6.57

New features
-TCP/IP socket buffers are now in extended memory,
 thus freeing up some root memory and allowing more
 sockets to be used.  This change required several
 other changes:
 * Use the macro MAX_SOCKETS to define the number
   of sockets that will be allocated (not including
   the socket for DNS lookups). Code that uses more
   than 4 sockets will not work without using the
   MAX_SOCKETS macro.
 * Use the macro SOCK_BUF_SIZE to determine the
   size of the socket buffers--note that a TCP
   socket will have two buffers of size
   (SOCK_BUF_SIZE / 2) for send and receive, and a
   UDP socket will have a single socket of size
   SOCK_BUF_SIZE.
 * Define the macro DISABLE_DNS to disable DNS
   lookups.  This prevents a UDP socket for DNS
   from being allocated, thus saving some memory.
 * tcp_MaxBufSize should no longer be used,
   although backwards compatibility is preserved.
 * Auto sockets (sockets allocated on the stack)
   should not be used. When auto sockets are
   deallocated (go out of scope), their buffer area
   will not be freed for future auto sockets to use.
-TCP/IP stack is reentrant, and can be used with uC/OS
-New function xmem2xmem() added
-New cloning option, CLONEWHOLEFLASH, allows user to
 clone entire flash device or just the program code.
-Flow control and parity control added to serial library

Bug Fixes

 Added to DC users manual as chap. 13.

-Fast Fourier Transform functions added:
 fftcplxinv, fftcplx, fftreal, fftrealinv, hanncplx,
 hannreal, powerspectrum
 Documented in DC users manual.

-A new flash driver has been added to the BIOS.  This
 driver recognizes a variety of small-sector flash
 devices and manufacturers.  In addition, an
 "ID block" on the flash device containing useful
 information about the product is now supported.
 A new macro, _BOARD_TYPE_, is internally defined by
 Dynamic C using the a field of the system ID block.

-Support for "cloning" (copying the contents of one
 boards flash device to another board via a special
 cable) has been added to the BIOS.  See the designers
 manual for more details.

-Dynamic C now determines the sizes of the RAM and
 Flash automatically so that manual changes to BIOS
 code are no longer necessary for different memory
 sizes. The determination is done during the boot-
 strap stage and is based on the hardware present.

-"No debug compile" compiles all code as "nodebug"
 to flash memory on target.  To run the program
 after compiling with this command, disconnect
 the target from the programming port and
 toggle the reset line.  Documented in DC users
 manual in chap. 12.

-"Compile to .bin file" compiles the program to a file
 with the .bin extension.  The .bin file may then be used
 with a flash burner to program similar flash devices.
 Documented in DC users manual in chap.12.

-Selecting RAM or FLASH located in the
 "Default BIOS Memory Setting" box in the "Compiler"
 options window now defines the macros _RAM_ or
 _FLASH_, respectively.  Using these macros,
 a single, user defined BIOS file can be developed
 for both types of memory.  Documented in DC users
 manual in chap. 12.

-The Help menu has new commands, "Operators" and
 "Keywords" which open the HTML index pages for the
 descriptions of those items.

-Stack Allocation Functions added; documented in DC users
 manual.
___________________________________________________

Other Functional Changes

-Constant data may be created in extended memory
 through the constructs xdata and xstring.
-Supports extended memory (xmem) allocation
 through function Xalloc.
-Supports allocation of multiple stack sizes
 through function Stack_Alloc.
-Sample program SEEPARAM.C added.
-RAM and flash BIOS files were merged.
-Serial open functions now automatically modify timer A1
 and use timer A1 when the baudrate specified is low
 enough to require a timer A1 modification.
-The two BIOS source files, JRABBIOS.C and JRAMBIOS.C
 have been replaced by one file, RABBITBIOS.C
-PILOT.BPF was renamed to PILOT.BIN
-JRABBIOS.RTI was renamed to RABBIOS.RTI
-The cycle time total in the assembly window is
 now updated continuously, not just when the mouse
 button is released.
-sprintf, printf and several other functions were made
 reentrant. The uC/OS-II documentation specifies which
 library functions are not reentrant.
-A new macro CLOCK_DOUBLER in the BIOS was added. If this
 macro is set to 1 (default) then clock speed is doubled
 by the BIOS code if the crystal frequency is <= 12.9 MHz.

Bug Fixes

-Defect #17 fixed. Illegal use of type void is now
 caught by the compiler.
-Defect #20 fixed. Adding a char to char value returned
 from a function works now. Compiler now promotes character
 math to integers to fix the bug and to more closely match
 ISO/ANSI C.
-Fixes bug with expression "*(p++)" where p is a pointer.
-Defect #22 fixed. Crashes were happening when too large a
 string was created with concatenation using continuations.
-Defect #27 fixed. Log functions now cause run-time
 error if given zero for an argument instead of returning
 a garbage value.

 &,|, and ^ with char operands.
-Defect #42 fixed. Problem indexing arrays with auto variable
 as index corrected.
-Defect #43 fixed. Error with subtraction of constants in
 pointer arithmetic corrected.
-Defect #44 fixed. Last line of library files was not compiled
 if a newline was not present.
-Defect #46 fixed. Specifying string length with a variable
 argument in printf, sprintf now works.
-Defect #47 fixed. Problem with incrementing/dereferencing
 a pointer corrected.
-Defect #51 fixed.  Xmem defect no longer crashes.

 now longer causes incorrect dereference.
-Defect #54 fixed.  Using a variable for the precision
 specifier in  sprintf, printf floating point output
 now works.
-Defect #55 fixed.  Returning a long value from a cofunction
 to an auto variable was generating an internal error.
-Defect #56 workaround.  A hardware bug that
 affected external interrupts has been circumvented
 via a new function, SetVectExtern2000(). Sample
 program Samples\Intrupts\Int0demo.c has been modified
 to reflect use the workaround. A new function
 GetVectExtern2000() has been created  also.
-Defect #57 fixed.  DC now correctly dereferences and casts
pointers from unsigned longs to unsigned integers.
-Defect #61 fixed. For find, find/replace, disassemble at
 address, and dump at address dialogs, current search
 string is properly added to list of previous search strings.
-Defect #62 fixed.  Clock counts in the Assembly window
 correctly now.
-Defect #63 fixed. Assembler generated bad code
 for adc hl, hl and rl hl.  The latter now generates
 a compiler error.

*****************************************************************
VERSION 6.17

New Features

 The processor instruction cycle times are now displayed in a
 column to the right of each opcode in the Assembly window.
 Selecting text in the Assembly window replaces the cycle time in
 the lowest selected row with the total of the cycle times in the
 selection when the left mouse button is  released. On the next
 mouse click, the original cycle time is restored. There are some
 instructions whose time cycle times depend on whether a branch
 is taken or the count stored in BC. These are not totaled and an
 asterisk will appear next to the total time if they are
 selected. Cycle times assume 0 wait states.

 The online documentation can be accessed from a new Help Menu
 command. The default URL can be changed in the Registry entry:
 Software/ZWorld/DCW/Rabbit/6.17/Dynamic C Personality/DEFAULTURL

 The Dump feature now has an option to dump the flash image to a
 binary file.
______________________________________________________

Other Functional Changes
