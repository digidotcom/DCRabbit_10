Generating SSL (X.509) Certificates
===================================

We removed the outdated GUI-based SSL certificate generator from Dynamic
C 10.72B, and recommend using a command-line version of OpenSSL to
generate certificates for use with Dynamic C's HTTPS server.

The OpenSSL project includes a Wiki page with links to [pre-compiled
binaries for Windows](https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries),
and many Linux distributions install OpenSSL by default.

The Dynamic C 10.72B installer includes pre-compiled OpenSSL 1.0.2j
binaries for [32-bit](./i386) and [64-bit](./x64_86) versions of Windows,
downloaded from [indy.fulgan.com](https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL/), along
with an example [openssl.cnf](./openssl.cnf) file.

To generate a self-signed certificate for use on a Rabbit module with
Dynamic C, open a command prompt and navigate to the appropriate
directory for your Windows installation (either `SSL_Utilities\i386\` for
32-bit or `SSL_Utilities\x64_86\` for 64-bit).

This command generates a 2048-bit RSA, SHA256-signed X.509 certificate
(saved as `mycert.crt`) using a random key (saved unencrypted and without
a passphrase as `mycert.key`):

    openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 ^
        -keyout mycert.key -out mycert.crt -config ..\openssl.cnf

*The caret (`^`) is just a line-continuation character to wrap the
long command across two lines.  Use a backslash (`\`) if generating
certificates under Linux.*

Recent versions of OpenSSL save private keys in PKCS#8 format (a PEM file
that starts with `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`).  Dynamic C doesn't support that
format, so you will need to convert it to PKCS#1 (a PEM file that
starts with `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY`):

    openssl rsa -in mycert.key -out mycert_rsa.key

Copy `mycert_rsa.key` (private key) and `mycert.crt` (public, self-signed
certificate) to your project directory, and make use of them as you would
use the `XXXkey.pem` and `XXXs.pem` files generated by the old GUI-based
utility.
