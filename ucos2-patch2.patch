This patch fixes an issue that can arise when using the AES opcodes
on a Rabbit 6000.  AES opcodes on Rabbit 6000 require canonical
ordering of Px/Px' registers.  We maintain the ordering as well as
possible, but need to ensure that task switching doesn't throw it off.

The Dynamic C 10.72F release includes the patched UCOS2.LIB file, but
the uC/OS-II source isn't included in the Open Source GitHub code
repository.  If your Dynamic C installation is based on 10.72E or
earlier, you will need to manually apply this fix using `patch`:

    patch -p1 --forward < ucos2-patch2.patch

Include the command-line option "--dry-run" to test the patch.  The
"--forward" option ignores the patch if already applied.
