Dynamic C 10.72A includes an update from TLS 1.0 to 1.2.  This document
summarizes the impact this may have on your programs, and calls out
changes to "Dynamic C TCP/IP User’s Manual, Volume 3: Security".

This document assumes your program was already working with Dynamic C
10.72 before attempting an upgrade to 10.72A.  SSL/TLS support has
changed with various Dynamic C releases, please test with 10.72 before
upgrading in order to isolate potential failures.

With TLS 1.2, Dynamic C 10.72A:
  - Is compatible with modern web browsers.
  - Removes support for insecure SSLv2, SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 protocols.
  - Removes support for insecure RC4 cipher and MD5 digest.
  - Automatically enables required AES128_CBC cipher.
  - Adds optional AES256_CBC cipher, SHA256 digests, and support for
    SHA256 signatures in X.509 (TLS/SSL) certificates.

Readers interested in the technical details of the switch from TLS 1.0
to TLS 1.2 might want to read section 1.1 of RFC4346 and section 1.2
of RFC5246, which document the differences between TLS 1.0/1.1 and
TLS 1.1/1.2 respectively.

   https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-1.2


Macros used to configure TLS 1.2 (in addition to existing
documentation):

TLS_VERBOSE: Define to see debugging information dumped to STDOUT that
   may help in troubleshooting or reporting connectivity issues.  Be
   sure to disable this in production firmware.

SSL_USE_AES256: Define to enable 256-bit versions of the AES128_CBC
   ciphersuites (in addition to AES128_CBC which is always required).

SSL_USE_PSK: Define to use pre-shared keys for authentication.

SSL_DONT_USE_RSA: Define to disable support for RSA certificates (you
   must then define SSL_USE_PSK to use pre-shared keys instead).

MP_SIZE: The new default value of 258 allows for 2048-bit RSA keys.
   Most certificates are currently using 2048-bit keys, but 4096-bit
   keys will only become more common (#define MP_SIZE 514).

SSL_DISABLE_LEGACY_DCC: If you aren't using the ".dcc" filetype, you
   can define this macro to reduce code size.

SSL_DISABLE_USERBLOCK: If you aren't storing certificates in the
   UserBlock, you can define this macro to reduce code size.

The following macros are no longer used or have been deprecated:

SSL_USE_AES: Defining this macro previously enabled the optional
   AES128_CBC cipher.  Since it's required by TLS 1.2, and support
   for the insecure RC4 cipher was removed, AES128_CBC is enabled
   by default and cannot be disabled.

SSL_DONT_USE_RC4: Support for RC4 was removed.

SSL_S_FORBID_MD5 and SSL_S_FORBID_RC4: TLS 1.2 doesn't use the MD5 
   digest or RC4 cipher, so it now ignores these flags.
