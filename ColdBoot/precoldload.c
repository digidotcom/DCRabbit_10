// WARNING: This cold loader must not use any Rabbit 4000 specific
// mainpage instructions.
// A good heuristic is all 8-bit loads not involving 'a' and all 8 bit
// arithmetic intsructions are on the 7F page. The best thing to do is look at
// the list file and search for the 7F prefix. But besides that, be extra
// careful that you're not using a 4000 only instruction.

// The '@' symbol designates parameters for the triplet utility. Right now it
// is designed to take a starting address, assumes that the binary is contiguous
// and takes io register settings in sequence and prefixes them to the triplets
// The utility knows macro names used in Dynamic C.

//@ SEGSIZE  0xC6
//@ STACKSEG 0x74
//@ DATASEG  0x3A

// start signals the end of io register values and gives the starting offset
// to the triplet utility.

//@ start  0x0000
//@ SPCR     0x80
