	Rabbit 5000 and new processors can boot directly off of a serial flash
	without the assistance of a PIC (which was needed by the Rabbit 4000).
	Bootstrap mode is entered and bytes are read in sets of three from the
	serial flash starting from flash offset 0. These triplets have the same
	format as triplets read during bootstrap via dynamic C, namely [High
	byte, Low byte, Value]. This boot loader must be turned into triplets by
	the triplet utility BL_triplets.exe and then embedded at address 0 of
	the program (the start of the BIOS). Note that the boot loader will not
	execute as regular code, as it embeds a jump over itself (otherwise we
	could not safely place it at the start of the BIOS).

	The strategy here is to have this boot loader placed into high physical
	memory. This is done using the dataseg register, which will make the
	data segment start at address 0x4000 and then make this equate to
	physical address 0x14000 (an arbitrary value greater than 64k). The boot
	loader will then load 64k from the serial flash into internal RAM (this
	is why the boot loader must live above 64k, as it also resides in
	internal RAM). 64k is sufficient to allow the BIOS to run as it would
	for other serial boot flash boards.

	Note that processor execution always begins at address 0, so you must
	place a jump to 0x4000 at address 0. This is done automatically by the
	boot load triplet generator.

	The triplet generator will pad the end of the boot loader with 0x00, up
	to the length of the boot loader (for now it's 512 bytes). If the boot
	loader ever needs to be expanded in the future, this value can be easily
	changed in BL_triplets.cpp.

	Use COMPILE_coldload_serflash_boot.dcp to compile this .C to a .BIN.
	Use BL_triplets.exe to convert to the .LIB:

	BL_triplets.exe ..\COLDLOAD_serflash_boot
		..\..\Lib\Rabbit4000\BIOSLIB\serial_flash_boot_loader.lib
